## Maestro Cue

**Cue** is Maestro's event-driven automation engine. A **subscription** listens for an event and fires a prompt at a target agent. Subscriptions are defined per-project in a YAML file.

### Configuration File

**Canonical path: `<project-root>/.maestro/cue.yaml`** — always write new configs here. The engine creates the `.maestro/` directory automatically on save.

Legacy path: `<project-root>/maestro-cue.yaml` (deprecated). The engine still reads it if present for backwards compatibility, but every save migrates to the canonical location, so do **not** write new files there.

When you need to find an existing config, check `.maestro/cue.yaml` first, then fall back to `maestro-cue.yaml` at the project root.

Each subscription has a unique `name`, an `event` type, an `enabled` flag, a `prompt` (with template variables), and event-specific fields.

### Event Types

| Event                 | Fires when…                                     | Key config fields                                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `app.startup`         | Maestro launches                                | —                                                     |
| `time.heartbeat`      | Every N minutes                                 | `interval_minutes`                                    |
| `time.scheduled`      | At specific clock times (cron-like)             | `schedule_times`, `schedule_days`                     |
| `file.changed`        | Files matching a glob are added/changed/removed | `watch` (glob)                                        |
| `agent.completed`     | An upstream agent finishes a run                | `source_session` (name or names)                      |
| `github.pull_request` | A PR matches a filter (polled)                  | `repo`, `gh_state`, `label`, `poll_minutes`, `filter` |
| `github.issue`        | An issue matches a filter (polled)              | `repo`, `gh_state`, `label`, `poll_minutes`, `filter` |
| `task.pending`        | Pending `- [ ]` tasks detected in watched files | `watch`                                               |
| `cli.trigger`         | Manually fired via `maestro-cli cue trigger`    | —                                                     |

### Pipelines vs. Chains (READ THIS FIRST)

A **pipeline** is a logical grouping of related subscriptions in `cue.yaml` — it's what shows up as one named card in the Cue dashboard / Pipeline Editor. A **chain** is a single subscription (or topology of subscriptions: linear chain, fan-out, fan-in) **inside** a pipeline.

**Two non-negotiable defaults — apply BOTH every time:**

1. **Group related chains under one pipeline.** Do not create one pipeline per chain. If the user describes several automations that share a theme (e.g., "morning briefing + EOD wrap-up + weekly review", or "PR triage + PR review + PR merge"), put them in the same pipeline. Separate pipelines are only justified when the work is genuinely unrelated (different domains, different agents, different lifecycles).
2. **One trigger → one agent node. Never fan-in by default.** Every subscription gets its own unique `target_node_key` (any UUID) so the Pipeline Editor renders each chain as its own visual line — even when several chains share the same `agent_id`. Fan-in (multiple triggers collapsing onto one shared node) is a deliberate, opt-in topology — never the result of omitting `target_node_key`. The user's reasoning: an individual chain trivially extends to `trigger → agent → agent`, while a fan-in node has to be untangled first to add a downstream stage.

How grouping is expressed in YAML:

1. **`pipeline_name` field on each subscription** — authoritative. Every subscription that belongs to the same pipeline gets the same `pipeline_name` value. This survives renaming individual subscriptions.
2. **`# Pipeline: Name (color: #hex)` comment header** at the top of `cue.yaml` declares the pipeline's display name and dot color in the UI.
3. **Naming convention** (legacy / human-friendly): the first subscription's `name` matches the pipeline name; additional chains use `Name-chain-1`, `Name-chain-2`, etc. The Pipeline Editor emits this convention automatically.
4. **`target_node_key`** (UUID) on every subscription — even the first one. Mixing keyed and unkeyed subs for the same `agent_id` is fragile: the legacy dedup-by-sessionName fallback can still collapse them depending on YAML ordering. Make every sub explicit.

```yaml

  - name: Daily Ops
    pipeline_name: Daily Ops

  - name: Daily Ops-chain-2

    schedule_times: ['16:00']
    schedule_days: [fri]
    agent_id: <reviewer-agent-id>
    target_node_key: 8a1b9d4e-3c5f-48a2-8e6d-9b1f4c7a2e85
    prompt: |
      Roll up the week. What moved, what stalled, what's next week's focus.
```

Three subscriptions, three different schedules, three distinct `target_node_key`s → three visually-separate chains in the editor (even when two of them share the same `agent_id`), **one pipeline**.

### Pipeline Topologies (within a pipeline)

**Default: independent chains, even when they share an agent.** When several subscriptions live in the same pipeline, give each its own unique `target_node_key` (any UUID will do) so the Pipeline Editor renders them as parallel chains rather than collapsing to a fan-in node. Whether they reuse one `agent_id` or use distinct ones is a separate decision — `target_node_key` controls the _visual_ graph; `agent_id` controls _which agent runs the work_.

- **Same `agent_id`, distinct `target_node_key`s** → one agent runs every chain (shared session, serialized queue), but each chain shows up as its own agent node labelled `Name (1)`, `Name (2)`, etc. This is the right default for a single-project pipeline whose stages are conceptually independent but happen to share one workspace.
- **Distinct `agent_id`s** → fully isolated agents per chain (separate context, can run in parallel). Reach for this only when the chains genuinely need different contexts, models, or project roots.
- **Same `agent_id` and same `target_node_key`** → real fan-in (multiple triggers / upstreams converge on one shared node). Reserve for cases where you actually need a single output point.

**Don't omit `target_node_key`** when several subs in a pipeline share an `agent_id`. Without it, the loader falls back to dedup-by-sessionName and silently collapses every sub onto one node — which is what produces the unintentional fan-in look.

Topologies available:

- **Chain:** A's `agent.completed` fires B. B's `agent.completed` fires C.
- **Fan-out:** one subscription's `fan_out: [agentA, agentB]` dispatches in parallel with per-target `fan_out_prompts`. Use `fan_out_node_keys` to give each target its own visual node.
- **Fan-in:** `source_session: [a, b, c]` fires once ALL listed sources complete (subject to `fan_in_timeout_minutes` / `fan_in_timeout_on_fail`). Each upstream output is available as `{{CUE_OUTPUT_<NAME>}}` (uppercased session name); `include_output_from` narrows which sources contribute to `{{CUE_SOURCE_OUTPUT}}`. **Reserve for cases where you genuinely need synchronized convergence** — e.g. summarizing three parallel research agents into one digest. Don't reach for fan-in just because several triggers happen to share a target.
- **Forwarding:** an intermediate agent can pass an upstream's output through to a downstream agent by listing the source name in `forward_output_from: [<name>]`. The forwarded value is exposed downstream as `{{CUE_FORWARDED_<NAME>}}`.
- **Command node:** a subscription with `action: command` that runs a shell command (`command.mode: shell`) or a `maestro-cli` call (`command.mode: cli`) instead of an AI prompt. Emits `agent.completed` like any other run, so a downstream agent reads its stdout via `{{CUE_SOURCE_OUTPUT}}` (use `source_sub: <command-sub-name>` to pin the chain to that command and not other completions in the same session). See **Command Nodes** below for the full schema.
- **`cli_output`:** an object `cli_output: { target: "<source-agent-id>" }`. When set, the run's stdout is returned to that agent (typically the one that ran `maestro-cli send` or `cue trigger --source-agent-id`). **Deprecated** — prefer a downstream `action: command` subscription with `command.mode: cli`.

All of the topologies above can (and usually should) live inside a single pipeline — set the same `pipeline_name` on every subscription that participates.

### Command Nodes (`action: command`)

A **Command node** is a subscription that runs a shell command or invokes `maestro-cli` instead of dispatching a prompt to an AI agent. There is no separate top-level YAML key, no `event: command` type, and no separate node-graph — it's just a normal subscription with `action: command` plus a `command:` block. It lives in the same `subscriptions:` array as agent-prompt subs and shares all the standard fields (`pipeline_name`, `target_node_key`, `source_session`, etc.).

**Schema:**

```yaml
- name: <unique-within-file>
  event: <any of the 9 event types — see Event Types table>
  enabled: true
  action: command            # required to become a Command node
  command:                   # required when action: command
    # ---- mode: 'shell' ----
    mode: shell
    shell: 'gh pr list --json number,title'   # required, non-empty string
    # ---- OR mode: 'cli' ----
    mode: cli
    cli:
      command: send          # required; only 'send' is supported today
      target: <session-id-or-name>             # required, supports template vars
      message: '{{CUE_SOURCE_OUTPUT}}'         # optional; default is exactly this
  # standard subscription fields all still apply (pipeline_name, target_node_key,
  # source_session, source_sub, event-specific fields like interval_minutes, etc.)
```

**Validator rules:** `command.mode` must be `'shell'` or `'cli'`; `command.shell` must be non-empty; `command.cli.command` must be `'send'`; `command.cli.target` must be non-empty; `command.cli.message` must be a string when present. **`fan_out` is rejected** on `action: command` subs — Command nodes do not fan out. `output_prompt` and the legacy `cli_output` field are silently skipped at runtime for command actions.

**Fields that are NOT configurable per node** (and what they actually use):

| Max output size      | No cap on capture itself. Multiple distinct caps apply downstream: **`{{CUE_SOURCE_OUTPUT}}` is sliced to `SOURCE_OUTPUT_MAX_CHARS = 5000`** before reaching the next agent's prompt — head-slice on the run-manager's output-prompt path (`cue-run-manager.ts`), tail-slice on the completion-service downstream chain path (`cue-completion-service.ts`). Independent of that, **CLI mode** truncates the forwarded message at **30 000 chars on Windows / 100 000 on POSIX** to stay under argv ceilings. **History** entries truncate `stdout` at 10 000 chars. The full uncapped stdout only exists in the in-memory `CueRunResult.stdout`. |

**SSH behavior:**

- `mode: shell` honors the owning session's SSH remote config — runs on the remote host via `bash -c <substituted-command>` with the remote `projectRoot` as cwd.
- `mode: cli` is intentionally **local-only**. `maestro-cli send` targets the local Maestro daemon, so SSH-wrapping it would point at the wrong daemon.

**Trigger compatibility:** **All 9 event types can fire a Command node directly** (`app.startup`, `time.heartbeat`, `time.scheduled`, `file.changed`, `agent.completed`, `github.pull_request`, `github.issue`, `task.pending`, `cli.trigger`). Event-specific required fields (`interval_minutes`, `schedule_times`, `watch`, `repo`, `source_session`, etc.) apply normally regardless of `action`. The only `action: command`-specific restriction is the `fan_out` rejection above.

**Output exposure & chaining (READ THIS):** Command runs route through the **same** completion path as agent runs and emit `agent.completed`. Downstream subscriptions chain off Command nodes the exact same way they chain off prompt subs — there is **no** separate `{{CUE_COMMAND_OUTPUT}}` variable, no separate event type:

| Variable                      | Value when source is a Command node                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{{CUE_SOURCE_OUTPUT}}`       | The command's captured stdout, sliced to `SOURCE_OUTPUT_MAX_CHARS = 5000` (head-slice on the output-prompt path, tail-slice on the downstream chain path — see "Max output size" above). |
| `{{CUE_SOURCE_STATUS}}`       | `completed` \| `failed` \| `timeout`                                                                                                                                                     |
| `{{CUE_SOURCE_EXIT_CODE}}`    | Numeric exit code (or `null` on spawn failure or signal-kill, e.g. timeout).                                                                                                             |
| `{{CUE_SOURCE_DURATION}}`     | Milliseconds.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `{{CUE_SOURCE_SESSION}}`      | Owning session **name** (Command nodes have no session of their own).                                                                                                                    |
| `{{CUE_SOURCE_TRIGGERED_BY}}` | The Command subscription's `name`.                                                                                                                                                       |

**Important chaining nuance:** because a Command node shares its owner's session, every completion in that session (the command run AND any agent run hosted there) emits `agent.completed` for the same `sourceSessionId`. To pin a chain sub to a specific upstream Command node, **set `source_sub` to the command sub's name** so the chain matches by `triggeredBy` instead of just by session:

```yaml
- name: after-shell-step
  event: agent.completed
  source_session: <owning-session-name>
  source_sub: my-shell-step # filters by triggeredBy = this sub name
  prompt: |
    The shell step said:
    {{CUE_SOURCE_OUTPUT}}
```

Without `source_sub`, the chain also fires on every other agent.completed in that session. `source_sub` accepts either a single name (`source_sub: my-shell-step`) or an array of names (`source_sub: [step-a, step-b]`) to OR-match completions from any of the listed upstream subscriptions — useful when one downstream chain should fan-in over several command nodes.

**Worked example — `app.startup` → shell → agent:**

```yaml
# Pipeline: Morning Repo Snapshot (color: #06b6d4)

subscriptions:
  - name: snapshot-shell
    pipeline_name: Morning Repo Snapshot
    target_node_key: 1d3e9c12-7a4b-4e9f-9c11-2f6d8b3a4c01
    event: app.startup
    enabled: true
    action: command
    command:
      mode: shell
      shell: |
        git log --since=yesterday --pretty='%h %s' &&
        echo --- &&
        gh pr list --state open --json number,title,author --limit 10

  - name: snapshot-summary
    pipeline_name: Morning Repo Snapshot
    target_node_key: 5e8d4a76-2b1f-4c3a-9e7d-3f4b8c1a6d92
    event: agent.completed
    enabled: true
    source_session: <owning-session-name> # the session that owns cue.yaml
    source_sub: snapshot-shell # pin to the shell step only
    agent_id: <briefer-agent-id>
    prompt: |
      Today's repo state (from the shell snapshot):

      {{CUE_SOURCE_OUTPUT}}

      Status: {{CUE_SOURCE_STATUS}}, exit {{CUE_SOURCE_EXIT_CODE}}.

      Give me a 5-bullet briefing: what shipped, what's open, who's blocked.

```bash
# List all subscriptions (including disabled) across agents

# Fire a subscription on demand (bypasses its event trigger)
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} cue trigger <subscription-name> \
    [-p, --prompt "custom prompt"] \
    [--source-agent-id {{AGENT_ID}}] \
    [--json]
```

Pass `--source-agent-id {{AGENT_ID}}` so a subscription with `cli_output` can route its result back to you as a reply.

### Authoring Guidance

When a user asks you to add, modify, or debug a Cue subscription:

1. Read the existing config first to understand current subscriptions, pipelines, and naming conventions. Check `.maestro/cue.yaml` (canonical) first, then `maestro-cue.yaml` at the project root (legacy fallback).
2. Keep subscription `name` values unique within the file — the engine keys on them.
3. **Group related chains under one pipeline.** Before adding a new subscription, check whether it belongs in an existing pipeline (matching theme, agent set, or domain) — if so, reuse that `pipeline_name` instead of creating a new pipeline. If the user describes several related automations in one request, emit them as multiple subscriptions sharing a single `pipeline_name`, not as separate pipelines.
4. **Within a pipeline, give each subscription its own `target_node_key`** (any UUID) so the Pipeline Editor renders the chains as separate visual lines instead of collapsing them onto one fan-in agent node. This applies whether the chains share an `agent_id` or not. Only reuse a `target_node_key` across subscriptions when you actually want a real fan-in node (multiple triggers/upstreams converging onto one shared agent node). If two chains genuinely need isolated context/models/project-roots, also give them distinct `agent_id`s (create with `{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} create-agent <name> --cwd <project>` if needed); otherwise reusing one `agent_id` is fine and often preferred.
5. **For Command nodes (shell scripts or `maestro-cli` calls inside a pipeline)** — see the **Command Nodes** section above for the full schema. The keyword is `action: command` plus a `command:` block; there is no separate top-level YAML key, no `event: command` type, and no separate node graph.
6. For full schema, field reference, and worked examples, fetch the official Cue docs: https://docs.runmaestro.ai/maestro-cue-configuration.md, https://docs.runmaestro.ai/maestro-cue-events.md, https://docs.runmaestro.ai/maestro-cue-advanced.md, https://docs.runmaestro.ai/maestro-cue-examples.md. Don't guess field names.
7. After writing, validate with `{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} cue list` — the engine reloads automatically when the file changes.

### Shared Workspaces: `settings.owner_agent_id`

When two or more agents are registered against the same project root (for example, an Opus and a Sonnet agent both pointing at the same Obsidian vault), every subscription in `cue.yaml` is either **pinned to a single agent** or **disabled** — there is no mode where an unowned subscription broadcasts to every agent in the root. Which state applies depends on `owner_agent_id` and the per-subscription `agent_id`:

- **Always prefer explicit `agent_id` per subscription** when you want a specific agent (or several, via chains / fan-out) to run work in a shared workspace. That is the reliable way to target multiple agents from one `cue.yaml`.
- **Set `settings.owner_agent_id`** to the agent's internal id (UUID) **or** display name to pin every _unowned_ subscription (no `agent_id`) to that agent. Prefer the UUID when two agents share a display name — a name with multiple matches is flagged as ambiguous and unowned subs are disabled until it's resolved.
- **If `owner_agent_id` is unset and >1 agent shares the root**, the first agent in the session list is picked as a deterministic fallback owner; non-winners are flagged in the Cue dashboard with a red warning pointing to `owner_agent_id`. Do not rely on this fallback — set `owner_agent_id` explicitly.
- **If `owner_agent_id` is set but no agent in the root matches it**, every agent there is flagged and unowned subscriptions are disabled until the value is fixed.

When authoring `cue.yaml` for a workspace that may be registered under more than one agent, set `owner_agent_id` proactively. Use `{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} list agents` to discover ids and names.

### Natural-Language → YAML Recipes

Translate the user's phrasing into one of these starter templates, then adapt names/prompts/agent ids. Always set `agent_id` to the target agent (use `{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} list agents` to find ids).

**Each recipe below is a single chain.** When a user request maps to more than one chain:

- Assign every chain the same `pipeline_name` (and add a `# Pipeline: Name (color: #hex)` comment header at the top of the file) so they group into one pipeline in the UI. Only split into separate pipelines when the chains are genuinely unrelated.
- **Add a unique `target_node_key` (any UUID) to every subscription** — the recipes below omit it because they're standalone single-chain examples, but the moment you emit two or more subscriptions in one file you must give each its own key. Otherwise the Pipeline Editor collapses them into one fan-in agent node, which is never the default we want. The `agent.completed (fan-in)` recipe is the one exception — that's a deliberate convergence node.

**"Every morning at 9am, remind me to…" / "Every Friday afternoon…" → `time.scheduled`**

```yaml

  event: agent.completed
  enabled: true
  source_session: implementer
  agent_id: <reviewer-agent-id>
  prompt: |
    The implementer just finished:

    {{CUE_SOURCE_OUTPUT}}

    Status: {{CUE_SOURCE_STATUS}}. Review for correctness and style;
    respond with a short approval or a numbered list of required changes.
```

**"When all of A, B, and C complete, summarize" → `agent.completed` (fan-in)**

```yaml
- name: sync-after-parallel-work
  event: agent.completed
  enabled: true
  source_session: [agent-a, agent-b, agent-c]
  fan_in_timeout_minutes: 60
  fan_in_timeout_on_fail: continue
  agent_id: <synthesizer-agent-id>
  prompt: |
    Three agents just finished:

    A: {{CUE_OUTPUT_AGENT_A}}
    B: {{CUE_OUTPUT_AGENT_B}}
    C: {{CUE_OUTPUT_AGENT_C}}

    Produce a unified summary suitable for a daily digest.
```

**"Watch for new PRs on this repo" → `github.pull_request`**

  repo: owner/name
  gh_state: open
  poll_minutes: 10
  agent_id: <triage-agent-id>
  prompt: |
    New PR #{{CUE_GH_NUMBER}} from @{{CUE_GH_AUTHOR}}: "{{CUE_GH_TITLE}}".
    {{CUE_GH_URL}}

    Skim the diff, suggest reviewers, and propose labels.
```

**"When pending tasks pile up in /docs/tasks, work on them" → `task.pending`**

```yaml
- name: drain-task-backlog
  event: task.pending
  enabled: true
  watch: 'docs/tasks/*.md'
  agent_id: <worker-agent-id>
  prompt: |
    File `{{CUE_TASK_FILE_NAME}}` has {{CUE_TASK_COUNT}} unchecked items:

    {{CUE_TASK_LIST}}

    Pick up the highest-priority unchecked task and complete it.
```

**"Run this shell command, then have an agent work on the output" → `action: command` (shell) → `agent.completed` chain**

```yaml
- name: gather-pr-list
  event: time.heartbeat
  enabled: true
  interval_minutes: 30
  action: command
  command:
    mode: shell
    shell: 'gh pr list --state open --json number,title,author,updatedAt --limit 20'

- name: triage-prs
  event: agent.completed
  enabled: true
  source_session: <owning-session-name>
  source_sub: gather-pr-list # pin chain to the shell step only
  agent_id: <triage-agent-id>
  prompt: |
    Open PRs (from `gh pr list`):

    {{CUE_SOURCE_OUTPUT}}

    Flag anything stale (>3 days no update) and suggest a reviewer for each.
```

**"After this agent finishes, send its output to another agent over `maestro-cli`" → `action: command` (cli)**

```yaml
- name: forward-summary
  event: agent.completed
  enabled: true
  source_session: <upstream-agent-name>
  action: command
  command:
    mode: cli
    cli:
      command: send
      target: <downstream-agent-id-or-name>
      # message defaults to '{{CUE_SOURCE_OUTPUT}}' when omitted
```

After authoring, write the YAML to `<project-root>/.maestro/cue.yaml` (create the `.maestro/` directory if it doesn't exist), then run `{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} cue list` to confirm the engine sees it.
