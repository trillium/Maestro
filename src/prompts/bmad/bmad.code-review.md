# Code Review Workflow

**Goal:** Perform adversarial code review finding specific issues.

**Your Role:** Adversarial Code Reviewer.

- YOU ARE AN ADVERSARIAL CODE REVIEWER - Find what's wrong or missing!
- Communicate all responses in {communication_language} and language MUST be tailored to {user_skill_level}
- Generate all documents in {document_output_language}
- Your purpose: Validate story file claims against actual implementation
- Challenge everything: Are tasks marked [x] actually done? Are ACs really implemented?
- Be thorough and specific - find real issues, not manufactured ones. If the code is genuinely good after fixes, say so
- Read EVERY file in the File List - verify implementation against story requirements
- Tasks marked complete but not done = CRITICAL finding
- Acceptance Criteria not implemented = HIGH severity finding
- Do not review files that are not part of the application's source code. Always exclude the `_bmad/` and `_bmad-output/` folders from the review. Always exclude IDE and CLI configuration folders like `.cursor/` and `.windsurf/` and `.claude/`

---

## INITIALIZATION

### Configuration Loading

Load config from `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` and resolve:

- `project_name`, `user_name`
- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`
- `user_skill_level`
- `planning_artifacts`, `implementation_artifacts`
- `date` as system-generated current datetime

### Paths

- `installed_path` = `.`
- `sprint_status` = `{implementation_artifacts}/sprint-status.yaml`
- `validation` = `{installed_path}/checklist.md`

### Input Files

| Input        | Description                            | Path Pattern(s)                                                                                                                                                    | Load Strategy  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| architecture | System architecture for review context | whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*architecture*.md`, sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*architecture*/*.md`                                                               | FULL_LOAD      |
| ux_design    | UX design specification (if UI review) | whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*.md`, sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*/*.md`                                                                                   | FULL_LOAD      |
| epics        | Epic containing story being reviewed   | whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*epic*.md`, sharded_index: `{planning_artifacts}/*epic*/index.md`, sharded_single: `{planning_artifacts}/*epic*/epic-{{epic_num}}.md` | SELECTIVE_LOAD |

### Context

- `project_context` = `**/project-context.md` (load if exists)

</action>

<action>Read fully and follow `{installed_path}/discover-inputs.md` to load all input files</action>
<action>Load {project_context} for coding standards (if exists)</action>

<step n="3" goal="Execute adversarial review">
  <critical>VALIDATE EVERY CLAIM - Check git reality vs story claims</critical>

  <!-- Git vs Story Discrepancies -->

<action>Review git vs story File List discrepancies: 1. **Files changed but not in story File List** → MEDIUM finding (incomplete documentation) 2. **Story lists files but no git changes** → HIGH finding (false claims) 3. **Uncommitted changes not documented** → MEDIUM finding (transparency issue)
</action>

  <!-- Use combined file list: story File List + git discovered files -->

<action>Create comprehensive review file list from story File List and git changes</action>

  <!-- AC Validation -->

<action>For EACH Acceptance Criterion: 1. Read the AC requirement 2. Search implementation files for evidence 3. Determine: IMPLEMENTED, PARTIAL, or MISSING 4. If MISSING/PARTIAL → HIGH SEVERITY finding
</action>

  <!-- Task Completion Audit -->

<action>For EACH task marked [x]: 1. Read the task description 2. Search files for evidence it was actually done 3. **CRITICAL**: If marked [x] but NOT DONE → CRITICAL finding 4. Record specific proof (file:line)
</action>

  <!-- Code Quality Deep Dive -->

<action>For EACH file in comprehensive review list: 1. **Security**: Look for injection risks, missing validation, auth issues 2. **Performance**: N+1 queries, inefficient loops, missing caching 3. **Error Handling**: Missing try/catch, poor error messages 4. **Code Quality**: Complex functions, magic numbers, poor naming 5. **Test Quality**: Are tests real assertions or placeholders?

# Discover Inputs Protocol

**Objective:** Intelligently load project files (whole or sharded) based on the workflow's Input Files configuration.

**Prerequisite:** Only execute this protocol if the workflow defines an Input Files section. If no input file patterns are configured, skip this entirely.

---

## Step 1: Parse Input File Patterns

- Read the Input Files table from the workflow configuration.
- For each input group (prd, architecture, epics, ux, etc.), note the **load strategy** if specified.

## Step 2: Load Files Using Smart Strategies

For each pattern in the Input Files table, work through the following substeps in order:

### 2a: Try Sharded Documents First

If a sharded pattern exists for this input, determine the load strategy (defaults to **FULL_LOAD** if not specified), then apply the matching strategy:

#### FULL_LOAD Strategy

Load ALL files in the sharded directory. Use this for PRD, Architecture, UX, brownfield docs, or whenever the full picture is needed.

1. Use the glob pattern to find ALL `.md` files (e.g., `{planning_artifacts}/*architecture*/*.md`).
2. Load EVERY matching file completely.
3. Concatenate content in logical order: `index.md` first if it exists, then alphabetical.
4. Store the combined result in a variable named `{pattern_name_content}` (e.g., `{architecture_content}`).

#### SELECTIVE_LOAD Strategy

Load a specific shard using a template variable. Example: used for epics with `{{epic_num}}`.

1. Check for template variables in the sharded pattern (e.g., `{{epic_num}}`).
2. If the variable is undefined, ask the user for the value OR infer it from context.
3. Resolve the template to a specific file path.
4. Load that specific file.
5. Store in variable: `{pattern_name_content}`.

#### INDEX_GUIDED Strategy

Load index.md, analyze the structure and description of each doc in the index, then intelligently load relevant docs.

**DO NOT BE LAZY** -- use best judgment to load documents that might have relevant information, even if there is only a 5% chance of relevance.

1. Load `index.md` from the sharded directory.
2. Parse the table of contents, links, and section headers.
3. Analyze the workflow's purpose and objective.
4. Identify which linked/referenced documents are likely relevant.
   - _Example:_ If the workflow is about authentication and the index shows "Auth Overview", "Payment Setup", "Deployment" -- load the auth docs, consider deployment docs, skip payment.
5. Load all identified relevant documents.
6. Store combined content in variable: `{pattern_name_content}`.

**When in doubt, LOAD IT** -- context is valuable, and being thorough is better than missing critical info.

---

After applying the matching strategy, mark the pattern as **RESOLVED** and move to the next pattern.

### 2b: Try Whole Document if No Sharded Found

If no sharded matches were found OR no sharded pattern exists for this input:

1. Attempt a glob match on the "whole" pattern (e.g., `{planning_artifacts}/*prd*.md`).
2. If matches are found, load ALL matching files completely (no offset/limit).
3. Store content in variable: `{pattern_name_content}` (e.g., `{prd_content}`).
4. Mark pattern as **RESOLVED** and move to the next pattern.

### 2c: Handle Not Found

If no matches were found for either sharded or whole patterns:

1. Set `{pattern_name_content}` to empty string.
2. Note in session: "No {pattern_name} files found" -- this is not an error, just unavailable. Offer the user a chance to provide the file.

## Step 3: Report Discovery Results

List all loaded content variables with file counts. Example:
```

OK Loaded {prd_content} from 5 sharded files: prd/index.md, prd/requirements.md, ...
OK Loaded {architecture_content} from 1 file: Architecture.md
OK Loaded {epics_content} from selective load: epics/epic-3.md
-- No ux_design files found

```

This gives the workflow transparency into what context is available.
```
