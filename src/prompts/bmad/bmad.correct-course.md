# Correct Course - Sprint Change Management Workflow

**Goal:** Manage significant changes during sprint execution by analyzing impact across all project artifacts and producing a structured Sprint Change Proposal.

**Your Role:** You are a Scrum Master navigating change management. Analyze the triggering issue, assess impact across PRD, epics, architecture, and UX artifacts, and produce an actionable Sprint Change Proposal with clear handoff.

---

## INITIALIZATION

### Configuration Loading

Load config from `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` and resolve:

- `project_name`, `user_name`
- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`
- `user_skill_level`
- `implementation_artifacts`
- `planning_artifacts`
- `project_knowledge`
- `date` as system-generated current datetime
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`
- Language MUST be tailored to `{user_skill_level}`
- Generate all documents in `{document_output_language}`
- DOCUMENT OUTPUT: Updated epics, stories, or PRD sections. Clear, actionable changes. User skill level (`{user_skill_level}`) affects conversation style ONLY, not document updates.

### Paths

- `installed_path` = `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/correct-course`
- `checklist` = `{installed_path}/checklist.md`
- `default_output_file` = `{planning_artifacts}/sprint-change-proposal-{date}.md`

### Input Files

| Input            | Path                                                                                                     | Load Strategy |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| PRD              | `{planning_artifacts}/*prd*.md` (whole) or `{planning_artifacts}/*prd*/*.md` (sharded)                   | FULL_LOAD     |
| Epics            | `{planning_artifacts}/*epic*.md` (whole) or `{planning_artifacts}/*epic*/*.md` (sharded)                 | FULL_LOAD     |
| Architecture     | `{planning_artifacts}/*architecture*.md` (whole) or `{planning_artifacts}/*architecture*/*.md` (sharded) | FULL_LOAD     |
| UX Design        | `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*.md` (whole) or `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*/*.md` (sharded)                     | FULL_LOAD     |
| Tech Spec        | `{planning_artifacts}/*tech-spec*.md` (whole)                                                            | FULL_LOAD     |
| Document Project | `{project_knowledge}/index.md` (sharded)                                                                 | INDEX_GUIDED  |

### Context

- `project_context` = `**/project-context.md` (load if exists)

---

## EXECUTION

### Document Discovery - Loading Project Artifacts

**Strategy**: Course correction needs broad project context to assess change impact accurately. Load all available planning artifacts.

**Discovery Process for FULL_LOAD documents (PRD, Epics, Architecture, UX Design, Tech Spec):**

1. **Search for whole document first** - Look for files matching the whole-document pattern (e.g., `*prd*.md`, `*epic*.md`, `*architecture*.md`, `*ux*.md`, `*tech-spec*.md`)
2. **Check for sharded version** - If whole document not found, look for a directory with `index.md` (e.g., `prd/index.md`, `epics/index.md`)
3. **If sharded version found**:
   - Read `index.md` to understand the document structure
   - Read ALL section files listed in the index
   - Process the combined content as a single document
4. **Priority**: If both whole and sharded versions exist, use the whole document

**Discovery Process for INDEX_GUIDED documents (Document Project):**

1. **Search for index file** - Look for `{project_knowledge}/index.md`
2. **If found**: Read the index to understand available documentation sections
3. **Selectively load sections** based on relevance to the change being analyzed - do NOT load everything, only sections that relate to the impacted areas
4. **This document is optional** - skip if `{project_knowledge}` does not exist (greenfield projects)

**Fuzzy matching**: Be flexible with document names - users may use variations like `prd.md`, `bmm-prd.md`, `product-requirements.md`, etc.

**Missing documents**: Not all documents may exist. PRD and Epics are essential; Architecture, UX Design, Tech Spec, and Document Project are loaded if available. HALT if PRD or Epics cannot be found.
