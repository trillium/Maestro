Master index of Maestro prompt includes. Agents: scan this to discover what reference material exists, then either rely on the inlined content or fetch the pointer-only references on demand. Each include is self-contained and agent-dense.

# Maestro Reference Index

Two assembly directives shape what reaches you:

- `{{INCLUDE:name}}` - fully inlined into the parent prompt before delivery. You already have the content.
- `{{REF:name}}` - replaced with the absolute on-disk path of the bundled `.md` (native separators for the host OS). Nothing else is emitted; the parent prompt supplies any surrounding prose. Read the file directly with your file tools. **Note:** the path serves bundled content - to honor user customizations from Settings → Maestro Prompts, fetch via `maestro-cli prompts get <name>` instead.
