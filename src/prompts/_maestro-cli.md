## Maestro CLI

Maestro provides a command-line interface (`maestro-cli`) that you can use to interact with the running Maestro application on behalf of the user. Invoke it with:

```bash
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}}
```

Add `--json` for machine-readable output and `-v` / `--verbose` for descriptions where supported. Prefer the CLI over telling the user to click through the UI - every setting and feature is reachable through it.

### Settings Management

Read or change any Maestro setting or per-agent configuration. Changes take effect instantly in the running desktop app - no restart required.

```bash
# Discover all available settings with descriptions
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} settings list -v

# Filter discovery by category (appearance, shell, editor, ...)
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} settings list -v -c <category>

# Show only key names for fast scanning
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} settings list --keys-only

# Read / write / reset a specific setting (supports dot-notation, e.g. encoreFeatures.directorNotes)
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} settings get <key> [-v]
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} settings set <key> <value> [--raw '<json>']
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} settings reset <key>

# Per-agent configuration (overrides global settings)
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} settings agent list [agent-id]
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} settings agent get <agent-id> <key>
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} settings agent set <agent-id> <key> <value>
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} settings agent reset <agent-id> <key>
```

**Recommended workflow when a user asks about a preference, theme, behavior, or "can I configure…":**

1. **Discover** - run `settings list -v` (or `-c <category>` to narrow). Identify candidate keys whose names or descriptions match the user's intent.
2. **Inspect current value** - `settings get <key> -v` to show the current value and the type/default. Don't recommend changing something that's already set how the user wants.
3. **Recommend** - present the 1-3 most relevant keys in a short list with current value, what it controls, and the value you propose. Keep the recommendation tight; don't dump the full settings catalogue on the user.
4. **Apply** - once the user confirms (or if the request was already explicit), run `settings set <key> <value>`. Auto-detection handles bool/number/JSON/string; pass `--raw '<json>'` for explicit JSON values.
5. **Confirm** - re-read with `settings get <key>` and report the result.

For per-agent overrides (e.g., `nudge`, `model`, `effort`, `customArgs`), use `settings agent set <agent-id> <key> <value>` - those override the global value for that one agent only.

#### Encore Features (gated capabilities)

Several optional surfaces ship behind feature flags so users opt in deliberately. The flags live under `encoreFeatures.*` and gate four capabilities:

| Flag                           | Surface                 | Status | One-line pitch                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `encoreFeatures.maestroCue`    | Maestro Cue automation  | Beta   | Event-driven automation - trigger agent prompts on timers, file changes, agent completions, GitHub PRs/issues, pending tasks, and CLI hooks |
| `encoreFeatures.directorNotes` | Director's Notes        | Beta   | Unified history view across all sessions plus AI-generated synopses of recent activity                                                      |
| `encoreFeatures.symphony`      | Maestro Symphony        | Stable | Contribute to open source projects through curated playbook registries                                                                      |
| `encoreFeatures.usageStats`    | Usage & Stats Dashboard | Stable | Track queries, Auto Run sessions, model usage, and view the Usage Dashboard                                                                 |

**Gating workflow.** When the user describes an intent that maps to one of these surfaces:

1. **Check** - `maestro-cli settings get encoreFeatures.<flag>`. If `true`, proceed.
2. **Pitch** - if `false`, do NOT silently enable the feature. Tell the user what they're asking for needs an Encore feature, give a brief pitch from the per-flag copy below, and offer to enable it. Frame it as a one-command opt-in, not a setup chore.
3. **Enable on confirm** - `maestro-cli settings set encoreFeatures.<flag> true`. Effect is instant - no restart.
4. **Verify and continue** - re-read with `settings get`, then carry out the original request.

If the user declines, offer a fallback (e.g., for "remind me every morning" without Cue, suggest a manual reminder pattern or a one-shot `maestro-cli send` triggered later).

**Per-flag pitch copy** (adapt to the actual request - don't read verbatim):

- **Maestro Cue:** "What you're asking for is event-driven automation - Maestro can do this natively, but it lives behind an Encore feature called **Maestro Cue** that's currently disabled. Cue lets you wire any agent to fire on a schedule, when a file changes, when another agent finishes, when a PR opens, or when pending `- [ ]` tasks pile up in a watched file. The whole config is one YAML file at `.maestro/cue.yaml`, and changes hot-reload - no restart. I can flip it on for you in one command and then build the [time-based / file-watch / chained] subscription you described. Want me to enable it?"
  Trigger phrases: "every morning", "every Friday", "every N minutes", "remind me", "watch this file", "when this PR opens", "after agent X finishes", "kick off when…".
- **Director's Notes:** "I can pull a unified view of what your fleet has been doing, but the cross-agent history view and AI-generated daily synopsis live behind an Encore feature called **Director's Notes**, which is currently off. With it on, I can give you a real briefing - what each agent shipped today, what's still in flight, and a short AI summary you can read in 30 seconds. Want me to enable it?"
  Trigger phrases: "summarize today", "what did the fleet do", "give me a briefing", "what changed across agents", "weekly recap".
- **Maestro Symphony:** "What you're describing taps into **Maestro Symphony**, an Encore feature for browsing and contributing to curated open-source playbook registries. It's currently disabled. Turn it on and you can pull community-vetted playbooks straight into your fleet, or publish your own. Want me to enable it?"
  Trigger phrases: "contribute to open source", "find a playbook for X", "browse playbooks", "publish my playbook".
- **Usage & Stats:** "I can track that for you, but the Usage & Stats Dashboard - token use, session counts, Auto Run timing - is an Encore feature called **Usage & Stats** and it's currently off. Enabling it also turns on the underlying stats collection so you'll have real numbers to look at next time. Want me to flip it on?"
  Trigger phrases: "how much have I used", "token usage", "show my stats", "model spend", "usage dashboard", "how long was that run".

**Toggle commands.** Set each flag individually with dot-notation (auto-detects boolean):

```bash
maestro-cli settings set encoreFeatures.maestroCue true
maestro-cli settings set encoreFeatures.directorNotes true
```

Or set the whole object at once (positional value parsed as JSON because it starts with `{`):

```bash
maestro-cli settings set encoreFeatures '{"maestroCue":true,"directorNotes":true,"symphony":false,"usageStats":true}'
```

Reverse with `false` or `maestro-cli settings reset encoreFeatures.<flag>`.

### Send Message to Agent

Send a message to another agent and receive a JSON response. Useful for inter-agent coordination.

```bash
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} send <agent-id> "Your message here" [-s <session-id>] [-r] [-t] [-l] [--new-tab] [-f]
```

| Flag                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-s, --session <id>` | Resume an existing session instead of creating a new one                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `-r, --read-only`    | Run in read-only mode (agent cannot modify files)                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `-t, --tab`          | Open/focus the agent's session tab in Maestro                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `-l, --live`         | **Deprecated - use `dispatch` instead.** Route the message through the Maestro desktop so it appears in the agent's tab                                                                                                               |
| `--new-tab`          | With `--live`, create a new AI tab and send the prompt into it                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `-f, --force`        | With `--live`, bypass the busy-state guard so you can dispatch concurrent writes to a single agent's active tab. Gated by the `allowConcurrentSend` setting (off by default); errors out with code `FORCE_NOT_ALLOWED` if not enabled |

### Dispatch a Prompt to a Desktop Tab

Hand a prompt to an agent in the running Maestro desktop and get back the tab/session id so you can address the same tab on follow-up calls. This is the replacement for `send --live`: same desktop-handoff behavior, but no synchronous response and no need to own a persistent channel - pollers and pipelines (Cue, Maestro-Discord, etc.) re-target by tab id.

```bash
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} dispatch <agent-id> "Your message here" [--new-tab] [-s <tab-id>] [-f]
```

| Flag                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--new-tab`          | Create a fresh AI tab in the target agent and dispatch the prompt into it. Mutually exclusive with `-s` and `-f` (a new tab is never busy)                                             |
| `-s, --session <id>` | Target an existing tab by its tab id (returned from a previous `dispatch`). Mutually exclusive with `--new-tab`                                                                        |
| `-f, --force`        | Bypass the busy-state guard when writing to a busy tab. Gated by `allowConcurrentSend` (off by default); errors out with code `FORCE_NOT_ALLOWED`. Cannot be combined with `--new-tab` |

Output (always JSON; `sessionId` and `tabId` are duplicates of the same value, kept for caller convenience):

```json
{ "success": true, "agentId": "a1b2c3d4-...", "sessionId": "tab-xyz", "tabId": "tab-xyz" }
```

Error codes: `INVALID_OPTIONS`, `AGENT_NOT_FOUND`, `FORCE_NOT_ALLOWED`, `MAESTRO_NOT_RUNNING`, `SESSION_NOT_FOUND`, `NEW_TAB_NO_ID`, `COMMAND_FAILED`. `NEW_TAB_NO_ID` fires when the desktop acks `--new-tab` without returning a tab id, leaving nothing to chain follow-up dispatches against. Requires the desktop app to be running.

#### Messages that start with a dash

Messages whose first character is a dash (em-dash `-`, en-dash `-`, double-dash `--`, minus `-`) collide with option parsing and will be rejected as unknown flags. Use the standard `--` end-of-options separator so the message is passed verbatim:

```bash
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} send <agent-id> -- " -  -  - revise the spec"
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} send <agent-id> -s <session-id> -- "--re-run"
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} dispatch <agent-id> -- "--force the rewrite"
```

Everything after `--` is treated as positional, so any flags (`-s`, `-r`, `-t`, `--new-tab`, `-f`) must come before the separator.

### Resource Listing and Inspection

```bash
# List resources
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} list agents
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} list groups
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} list playbooks
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} list sessions <agent-id>

# Inspect a specific resource
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} show agent <id>
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} show playbook <id>
```

### Auto Run Configuration

Configure and optionally launch an auto-run using documents you've created:

```bash
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} auto-run doc1.md doc2.md [--agent <id>] [--prompt "Custom instructions"] [--loop] [--max-loops <n>] [--launch] [--save-as "My Playbook"] [--reset-on-completion]
```

**Important:**

- Always pass `--agent {{AGENT_ID}}` when launching. Without it, the CLI selects the first available agent, which may not be the one you intended.
- **When the user asks you to _run_ or _kick off_ an auto-run, you must launch it via this command with `--launch`.** Do not read the document and execute its tasks yourself in chat - that bypasses the Auto Run engine, leaves no record in the UI, and loses the per-task fresh-context isolation. The whole point of an auto-run is that it shows up in the Auto Run panel and the engine drives it.

```bash
# Run a saved playbook by id (find ids with `list playbooks`)
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} playbook <playbook-id> [--dry-run] [--no-history] [--debug] [--verbose] [--wait] [--json]

# Clean up orphaned playbook data
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} clean playbooks [--dry-run]
```

### Cue Automation

```bash
# List all Cue subscriptions across agents
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} cue list [--json]

# Trigger a subscription by name (fires immediately, bypassing its event trigger)
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} cue trigger <subscription-name> [-p, --prompt <text>] [--source-agent-id <id>] [--json]
```

Pass `--source-agent-id {{AGENT_ID}}` so pipelines with `cli_output` can route results back to you. The Cue event model, YAML schema, and template variables are covered in the `_maestro-cue` include.

### Desktop Integration (Open / Refresh)

Use these after filesystem changes so the user sees updates immediately:

```bash
# Open a file in Maestro
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} open-file <file-path> [--session <id>]

# Open a URL as a browser tab (scheme-less inputs like `localhost:3000` are auto-prefixed with https://)
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} open-browser <url> [-a, --agent <id>]

# Open a fresh terminal tab (cwd must be inside the target agent's working directory)
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} open-terminal [-a, --agent <id>] [--cwd <path>] [--shell <bin>] [--name <label>]

# Refresh the file tree after multiple file changes
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} refresh-files [--session <id>]

# Refresh Auto Run documents after creating or modifying them
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} refresh-auto-run [--session <id>]
```

`open-browser` only accepts `http(s)` URLs. `open-terminal` defaults to `zsh`; pass `--shell` to override and `--name` to set the tab label.

### Notifications

You can surface two distinct kinds of notifications inside the desktop app. Both share a unified five-color design language; pick the kind that matches the message intent - they are not interchangeable.

| Kind             | When to use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Toast**        | Persistent, queued, dismissable. Top-right of screen. Use for results the user may want to act on later (build done, tests failed, PR opened, long task finished), errors, or anything where click-to-jump behavior is valuable. Fires audio/OS notifications when configured. Use `--dismissible` for messages the user MUST acknowledge.   |
| **Center Flash** | Momentary, single-slot, center-screen overlay (default 1.5s, max 5s). Use for "I did the thing" confirmation of a user-initiated action - quick acks, status nudges, brief success notes. Only one is visible at a time; a new flash replaces the active one. **Not** for errors, long-form messages, or anything the user might blink past. |

#### Color palette (shared)

`--color` accepts one of five values. Default is `theme` so the notification matches whatever theme the user is running.

| Color    | Use for                                                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `theme`  | **Default.** Generic confirmation with no semantic             |
| `green`  | Success ("Build passed", "Deploy complete")                    |
| `yellow` | Soft heads-up ("Quota at 60%")                                 |
| `orange` | Emphatic warning ("Approaching context limit", "Quota at 90%") |
| `red`    | Failure / blocked ("CI failed", "Auth expired")                |

```bash
# Toast - default theme, queue-based, click X to dismiss.
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} notify toast "<title>" "<message>" [--color <color>] [--timeout <sec>] [-a <agent-id>] [--json]

# Sticky toast - no auto-dismiss, requires user click. Use for critical messages.
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} notify toast "<title>" "<message>" --color red --dismissible

# Click actions - what happens when the user clicks the toast body.
# Body-click hierarchy: --open-file / --open-url (mutually exclusive) > --agent (+ optional --tab).
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} notify toast "<title>" "<message>" -a <agent-id>                       # jump to agent
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} notify toast "<title>" "<message>" -a <agent-id> --tab <tab-id>        # jump to specific AI tab
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} notify toast "<title>" "<message>" -a <agent-id> --open-file <path>    # open file in File Preview
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} notify toast "<title>" "<message>" --open-url <url>                    # open URL in system browser

# Inline action link - separate from the body click; renders a small link button beneath the message.
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} notify toast "<title>" "<message>" --action-url <url> [--action-label "<text>"]

# Center flash - momentary, exclusive, replaces any active flash.
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} notify flash "<message>" [--color <color>] [-D "<detail>"] [--timeout <sec>] [--json]
```

Caps:

- **Toast:** `--timeout` range `(0, 60]` seconds. Use `--dismissible` (no timeout, click to close) for messages the user must acknowledge. `--timeout` and `--dismissible` are mutually exclusive.
- **Center Flash:** `--timeout` range `(0, 5]` seconds (or `--duration <ms>` range `(0, 5000]`). No "never dismiss" option - flashes are by design momentary.

Click-action constraints:

- `--tab` requires `--agent` (a tab is scoped to an agent).
- `--open-file` requires `--agent` (File Preview is scoped to an agent) and is mutually exclusive with `--open-url`.
- `--action-label` requires `--action-url`.
- `--action-url` is **independent** of the body click - it renders a separate inline link button. Use it when the toast should both jump somewhere on body click and offer a side affordance (e.g. body click jumps to the agent, action link opens the PR).

Both commands accept `--variant` (toast: `--type`) as a deprecated alias for callers using the legacy semantic API (`success`/`info`/`warning`/`error` → `green`/`theme`/`yellow`/`red`). Prefer `--color` in new scripts.

Prefer toast for anything the user should be able to act on after the fact; prefer flash for fire-and-forget acknowledgement of an action they just took. Do not fire a flash from a long-running background task - by the time it appears the user is no longer looking at the screen. Reach for `--dismissible` only when the message is genuinely critical - every sticky toast is a tiny piece of homework you're handing the user.

### Status

```bash
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} status
```

### Agents and SSH Remotes

Lifecycle management of Maestro agents and remote-execution targets.

```bash
# Agents
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} create-agent <name> --cwd <path> [-t, --type <agent-type>] [-g, --group <id>] \
    [--nudge <message>] [--new-session-message <message>] [--custom-path <path>] \
    [--custom-args <args>] [--env KEY=VALUE]... [--model <model>] [--effort <level>] \
    [--context-window <size>] [--ssh-remote <id>] [--ssh-cwd <path>] \
    [--auto-run-folder <path>] [--json]
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} remove-agent <agent-id> [--json]

# SSH remotes (used by agents that execute on a remote host)
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} list ssh-remotes [--json]
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} create-ssh-remote <name> -H, --host <host> [-p, --port <port>] \
    [-u, --username <user>] [-k, --key <path>] [--env KEY=VALUE]... [--ssh-config] \
    [--disabled] [--set-default] [--json]
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} remove-ssh-remote <remote-id> [--json]
```

### Director's Notes

Unified history and AI-generated synopses across all agents.

```bash
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} director-notes history [-d, --days <n>] [-f, --format json|markdown|text] [--filter auto|user|cue] [-l, --limit <n>]
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} director-notes synopsis [-d, --days <n>] [--json]
```

### Gists

Publish an agent's session transcript to a GitHub gist. Routes through the running desktop app (which holds the live transcript) and uses the user's authenticated `gh` CLI under the hood.

```bash
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} gist create <agent-id> [-d, --description <text>] [-p, --public]
```

Defaults to a private gist; pass `-p` for public. Output is JSON with `gistUrl` on success. Requires the desktop app to be running and `gh` to be authenticated. Error codes: `AGENT_NOT_FOUND`, `MAESTRO_NOT_RUNNING`, `GIST_CREATE_FAILED`.

### Prompts (Self-Reference)

Read Maestro's own system prompts. `{{REF:_name}}` pointers in a parent prompt expand to nothing more than the bundled file's absolute on-disk path; the agent reads the file directly. Use the CLI here when you need the **customized** version (i.e., honors edits made in Settings → Maestro Prompts) rather than the bundled default.

```bash
# List every available prompt id with description
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} prompts list [--json]

# Fetch a single prompt's content (honors user customizations)
{{MAESTRO_CLI_PATH}} prompts get <id> [--json]
```

`<id>` is the prompt id from `prompts list`. Includes use leading underscores (e.g., `_maestro-cue`, `_autorun-playbooks`).
