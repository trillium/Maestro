/**
 * Semantic keys for a node that stay stable across save → reload. UI-created
 * nodes use timestamp-based ids (`trigger-1741234567890`, `agent-s1-1741234567900`)
 * while `yamlToPipeline` regenerates ids from a deterministic scheme on reload
 * (`trigger-0`, `agent-${sessionName}-${size}`). If we looked up positions by
 * node.id alone, first-save positions — keyed by the UI timestamp id —
 * would miss every lookup on the next open and every node would snap back to
 * the auto-layout default.
 *
 * Returns an array of keys in priority order. The first key is the most
 * stable identifier available; subsequent keys are fallbacks for layouts
 * written before that identifier was persisted on the node. When matching,
 * both sides write under EVERY key they produce; lookup tries each live key
 * in priority order against the saved index and uses the first hit.
 *
 * Stable identifiers used (in priority order):
 *   - trigger: `subscriptionName` (unique within the pipeline; written to
 *     YAML as the subscription `name` and re-stamped on every load).
 *   - agent:   `nodeKey` (UUID; round-trips through YAML via
 *     `target_node_key` / `fan_out_node_keys`).
 *   - command: `nodeKey` (UUID; same round-trip as agents).
 *
 * Legacy fallbacks (kept so old saved layouts without these fields still
 * resolve):
 *   - trigger: `eventType + index_among_all_triggers` — fragile to YAML
 *     reordering (e.g. the topo-sort introduced in #981 swaps trigger
 *     positions), which is why the subscriptionName key above was added.
 *   - agent:   `sessionKey + index_among_same_session_agents` — fragile to
 *     same-session-multiple-instance reordering across reload.

/**
 * Merge live pipelines with a saved layout, preserving node positions and

 *
 * When `savedLayout.selectedPipelineId` is explicitly `null` (meaning
 * "All Pipelines" was selected), that `null` is preserved — it is NOT
 * treated as "missing" and defaulted to the first pipeline.
 *
 * Each live pipeline is matched to a saved pipeline by id first (the normal
 * post-reload case) and falls back to name (covers the unsaved-rename case:
 * saved layout has the rename, live YAML does not). Node positions are then
 * resolved within the matched saved pipeline, preferring a content-derived
 * semantic key so first-save positions survive even though `yamlToPipeline`
 * regenerates node ids on reload. The legacy id-based key remains as a
 * fallback for layouts written before the semantic key was introduced.
