/**
 * Single source of truth for the markdown-it instance used by the Fast tier.
 *
 * Options chosen to roughly match the Rich-path's behavior:
 * - `html: true` mirrors `rehype-raw` (raw HTML passthrough).
 *   Sanitization happens downstream in `sanitize.ts`, so this is safe.
 * - `linkify: true` auto-detects bare URLs in text.
 * - `breaks: false` matches commonmark line-break semantics (rich path also
 *   uses commonmark-compatible breaks).
 * - `typographer: false` keeps output predictable and stable across themes.
 *
 * Creating fresh instances per parse is intentional — markdown-it is cheap to
 * construct (sub-millisecond) and per-instance state would otherwise need to
 * be reset between parses.
