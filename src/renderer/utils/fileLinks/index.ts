/**
 * Public surface of the shared file-link core.
 *
 * Both the Rich path (`remarkFileLinks`) and the Fast path
 * (`markdownItAdapter`) reuse the same matcher + patterns + tree-indices —
 * the barrel makes the contract obvious: consumers import the shapes and
 * helpers they need without deep paths.
 *
 * Add new exports here only when they're part of the public contract;
 * tier-internal helpers should stay deep-imported.
