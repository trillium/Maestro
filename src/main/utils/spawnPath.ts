/**
 * Spawn-time PATH builder that merges Maestro's hardcoded expanded PATH with
 * the user's cached login-shell PATH and any caller-supplied extra dirs.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 * Agent detection (`path-prober.ts`) uses `getExpandedEnvWithShell()`, which
 * inherits the user's login-shell PATH. That lets us find binaries installed
 * in non-standard locations (e.g. a custom `~/opt/node/bin` outside nvm/fnm/
 * volta/asdf). But the spawn path historically used only
 * `buildExpandedPath()` from `shared/pathUtils`, which knows the hardcoded
 * version-manager and Homebrew paths but NOT the user's custom shell
 * additions.
 *
 * Result: Maestro could detect an agent it couldn't actually run — the
 * script's shebang (e.g. `#!/usr/bin/env node`) couldn't find `node` in the
 * narrower spawn PATH. See issue #1016 for the codex-exit-127 repro.
 *
 * Precedence (highest first):
 *   1. extraPaths supplied by caller (e.g. dirname of the detected agent)
 *   2. Cached shell PATH (matches what detection saw)
 *   3. buildExpandedPath() defaults (Homebrew, nvm/fnm/volta/..., system bins)
