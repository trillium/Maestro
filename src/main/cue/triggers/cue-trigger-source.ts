/**
 * Common interface for every Cue trigger source.
 *
 * A trigger source owns the *external* mechanism for one subscription —
 * a setInterval timer, a chokidar watcher, a GitHub poller, etc. — and emits
 * `CueEvent`s through the context-supplied `emit` callback whenever the trigger
 * fires. Each source is responsible for its own start/stop lifecycle so the
 * runtime never has to know whether it owns timers, watchers, or pollers.
 *
 * The runtime keeps an array of `CueTriggerSource` per session and calls
 * `stop()` on each one when the session is torn down. Replaces the previous
 * `state.timers: Timer[]` + `state.watchers: (() => void)[]` parallel arrays.
