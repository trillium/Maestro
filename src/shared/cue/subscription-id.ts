 * legitimately define a sub with the same name. Composing
 * `${sessionId}::${pipeline}::${name}` gives a stable, parseable id that
 * survives that collision without needing to introduce a persisted uuid
 * onto every YAML row.
 *
 * Used by the web-server factory's `setGetCueSubscriptionsCallback` and the
 * follow-up `setSubscriptionEnabled` engine method so both sides agree on
 * the same identity contract.
