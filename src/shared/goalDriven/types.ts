/**
 * Type contracts for Goal-Driven Auto Run mode.
 *
 * Goal-Driven mode is the document-less counterpart to Maestro's existing
 * task/document-driven Auto Run. Instead of counting `- [ ]` checkboxes, the
 * agent pursues a free-text goal and, at the end of each iteration, emits a
 * structured `<!-- maestro:... -->` marker (see `goalMarkers.ts`) that the
 * engine parses to drive a progress bar and decide when to stop (see
 * `goalExitEvaluator.ts`).
 *
 * These types are pure data contracts — no Electron, React, or IPC. They are
 * consumed by later phases (the engine, the modal, the progress UI).
