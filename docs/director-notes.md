Director's Notes is your bird's-eye view of everything happening across all your AI agents. Instead of switching between tabs to check what each agent has been doing, Director's Notes aggregates all history entries into a single, searchable, filterable timeline - and can generate an AI-powered synopsis of recent activity.

<Note>
Director's Notes is an **Encore Feature** - it's disabled by default. Enable it in **Settings > Encore Features** to access the shortcut, menu entry, and command palette action.
</Note>

## Opening Director's Notes

**Keyboard shortcut:**

- macOS: `Cmd+Shift+O`
- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+O`

**From Quick Actions:**

- Press `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K` and search for "Director's Notes"

## Tabs

Director's Notes has three tabs:

### Unified History

The primary view - a chronological list of all history entries from every agent, newest first.

**Filtering:**

- **AUTO / USER** toggle buttons filter by entry type
- **Search** (`Cmd+F` / `Ctrl+F`) filters by summary text or agent name
- **Activity Graph** shows entry distribution over time; right-click to change the lookback window (24 hours through all time)

**Stats Bar:**
A centered aggregate stats bar displays key metrics across the current dataset:

- Total queries, sessions, AUTO entries, USER entries, and total cost

**Entry Details:**
Each entry shows:

- **Agent name** - which Maestro agent produced the entry
- **Task name pill** - clickable link to the originating session
- **Type badge** (AUTO or USER)
- **Summary** of what was accomplished
- **Duration** and **cost** (when available)
- **Timestamp**

Click any entry to open the **Detail Modal** with full response text, token breakdown, and navigation controls (Prev/Next or arrow keys).

**Session Navigation:**
Click the session pill on any entry to jump directly to that agent's tab - Director's Notes closes and focuses the agent with the relevant session loaded.

**Infinite Scroll:**
Entries load progressively (100 at a time). Scroll to load more as needed.

### AI Overview

An AI-generated synopsis of recent activity across all agents. This tab uses a configurable AI provider to read history files and produce a structured report.

**Controls:**

- **Lookback slider** - Adjust from 1 to 90 days to control the analysis window
- **Refresh** - Regenerate the synopsis with current settings
- **Save** - Export the synopsis as a markdown file
- **Copy** - Copy the raw markdown to clipboard

**Stats Bar:**
After generation, a stats bar shows:

- Number of history entries analyzed
- Number of agents with activity
- Generation time

**Synopsis Content:**
The AI produces a structured report organized by agent/project with sections for:

- **Accomplishments** - What was completed
- **Challenges** - Issues encountered or unresolved
- **Next Steps** - Recommended follow-up actions

The synopsis is rendered as rich markdown with full formatting support.

**Provider Configuration:**
Configure which AI provider generates the synopsis in **Settings > Encore Features**. Any installed agent (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode) can be used. The default lookback window is also configurable there.

<Note>
The AI Overview tab becomes available once the synopsis has finished generating. A spinning indicator on the tab shows generation is in progress. Results are cached for the session - switching tabs won't trigger a regeneration.

## Tips

- **Use AI Overview after an Auto Run session** to get a quick summary of everything that was accomplished across all agents
- **Search by agent name** in Unified History to isolate work from a specific project
- **Right-click the activity graph** to quickly change the time window without scrolling
- **Save or copy the synopsis** to include in standup notes, PRs, or project documentation
- **Session navigation** lets you jump directly from a history entry to the agent that produced it - great for resuming or reviewing work

## Pulling Notes from the CLI

The same unified history and AI synopsis are available from [`maestro-cli`](./cli#directors-notes), so you can pipe Director's Notes into shell scripts, cron jobs, or your own reporting tools without opening the app.

```bash
# Plain-text recap of the last 3 days
maestro-cli director-notes history -d 3

# Markdown recap of the last day, ready to paste into a doc or PR
maestro-cli director-notes history -f markdown -d 1

# Only the work you initiated (skip AUTO entries from Auto Run)
maestro-cli director-notes history --filter user -l 50

# JSON for piping into jq, a dashboard, or your own tooling
maestro-cli director-notes history --json -d 7

# AI synopsis of the past day (requires the desktop app to be running)
maestro-cli director-notes synopsis -d 1
```

### Generating a weekly report

Combine `synopsis` with a redirect (or your favorite scheduler) to produce a self-serve weekly report:

```bash
# Write this week's synopsis to a dated markdown file
maestro-cli director-notes synopsis -d 7 -f markdown \
  > ~/Documents/maestro-weekly-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md
```

Schedule it with `cron`, `launchd`, or [Maestro Cue](./maestro-cue) on a weekly interval to wake up to a fresh status report every Monday. Pair it with `maestro-cli notify toast --open-file <path>` if you want a clickable in-app reminder when the report lands.

<Note>
`history` reads directly from disk and works offline. `synopsis` needs the Maestro desktop app running because it dispatches the prompt through your configured AI provider.
