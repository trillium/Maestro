Maestro includes an extensible slash command system with autocomplete. Type `/` in the input area to open the autocomplete menu, use arrow keys to navigate, and press `Tab` or `Enter` to select.

## Built-in Maestro Commands

Maestro provides built-in slash commands that are handled internally (not sent to the AI agent):

| Command    | Description                                                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/history` | Generate a synopsis of recent work and add to the History panel         |
| `/wizard`  | Start the planning wizard for Auto Run documents                        |
| `/skills`  | List available Claude Code skills for this project _(Claude Code only)_ |

<Tip>
The `/wizard` command can take optional natural language input: `/wizard add user authentication feature` to provide initial context.
</Tip>

### Skills Enumeration

The `/skills` command displays all Claude Code skills available in your project. Skills are extensions that provide domain-specific knowledge and capabilities to Claude Code.

</Frame>

Skills are loaded from:

- **Project skills**: `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/skill.md` in your project directory
- **User skills**: `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/skill.md` for personal skills

Each skill is displayed with its name, approximate token count, and description. This command is only available when using Claude Code as your AI provider.

<Note>
The `/skills` command is a Maestro feature that reads skill files directly - it doesn't invoke Claude Code's native `/skills` command (which requires an interactive terminal).
</Note>

## Custom AI Commands

Create your own slash commands in **Settings → AI Commands**. Each command has a trigger (e.g., `/deploy`) and a prompt that gets sent to the AI agent.

Commands support **template variables** that are automatically substituted at runtime. These same variables also work in [core system prompts](/prompt-customization).

### Conductor Variables

| Variable                | Description                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `{{TAB_NAME}}`         | Custom tab name (alias: `SESSION_NAME`)                  |
| `{{TOOL_TYPE}}`        | Agent type (claude-code, codex, opencode, factory-droid) |

### Path Variables

| Variable             | Description                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `{{CWD}}`            | Current working directory      |
| `{{AUTORUN_FOLDER}}` | Auto Run documents folder path |

### Auto Run Variables

| Variable            | Description                                                 |

| `{{LOOP_NUMBER}}`   | Current loop iteration (5-digit padded: 00001, 00002, etc.) |

### Date/Time Variables

| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `{{DATE}}`       | Current date (YYYY-MM-DD)           |
| `{{TIME}}`       | Current time (HH:MM:SS)             |

| `{{WEEKDAY}}`    | Day of week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) |

### Git & Context Variables

| Variable            | Description                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `{{GIT_BRANCH}}`    | Current git branch name (requires git repo) |
| `{{IS_GIT_REPO}}`   | "true" or "false"                           |
| `{{CONTEXT_USAGE}}` | Current context window usage percentage     |

**Example**: A custom `/standup` command with prompt:

```
It's {{WEEKDAY}}, {{DATE}}. I'm on branch {{GIT_BRANCH}} at {{AGENT_PATH}}.
Summarize what I worked on yesterday and suggest priorities for today.
```

### Passing Arguments to Commands

Any text typed after a slash command is treated as arguments and included in the prompt sent to the agent.

**Explicit placement with `$ARGUMENTS`**: Use `$ARGUMENTS` in your prompt to control exactly where user input is inserted:

```
# Prompt for /plan command
Create a plan for: $ARGUMENTS
```

Typing `/plan user authentication flow` sends: `Create a plan for: user authentication flow`

**Automatic appending**: If your prompt doesn't contain `$ARGUMENTS`, any trailing text is automatically appended after the prompt:

```
# Prompt for /commit command
Please commit all changes with a descriptive message
```

Typing `/commit fix the login bug` sends:

```
Please commit all changes with a descriptive message

fix the login bug
```

<Tip>
Use `$ARGUMENTS` for precise control over where user input appears within your prompt. Omit it for simple commands where appending is sufficient.

## Spec-Kit Commands

Maestro bundles [GitHub's spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) methodology for structured feature development:

| Command                  | Description                                                   |

## OpenSpec Commands

Maestro bundles [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec) for spec-driven change management. These commands help you propose, implement, and archive changes systematically:

| Command               | Description                                                          |

| `/openspec.implement` | Convert OpenSpec tasks to Maestro Auto Run documents                 |

See [OpenSpec Commands](/openspec-commands) for the complete workflow guide and directory structure.

## Agent Native Commands

When using Claude Code, Maestro automatically discovers and displays the agent's native slash commands in the autocomplete menu. These commands are sent via the `system/init` event when Claude Code starts and appear with a "Claude Code command" label to distinguish them from Maestro's custom commands.

### Supported in Batch Mode

Claude Code runs in batch/print mode within Maestro, which means only certain native commands work. The following commands are **supported**:

| Command            | Description                                          |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `/compact`         | Compact conversation history to reduce context usage |
| `/cost`            | Show token usage and cost for the session            |
| `/init`            | Initialize a CLAUDE.md file in the project           |
| `/pr-comments`     | Address PR review comments                           |
| `/release-notes`   | Generate release notes                               |
| `/review`          | Request a code review                                |
| `/security-review` | Perform a security review                            |

Additionally, any **custom commands from Claude Code plugins/skills** (e.g., `/commit`, `/pdf`, `/docx`) are fully supported and will appear in the autocomplete menu.

### Not Supported in Batch Mode

The following Claude Code commands are **interactive-only** and don't work through Maestro:

| Command              | Reason                                                     |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/mcp`               | MCP server management requires interactive TUI             |
| `/help`              | Help display is interactive                                |
| `/clear`             | Conversation clearing is handled differently in batch mode |
| `/config`            | Configuration requires interactive prompts                 |
| `/model`             | Model switching mid-session requires TUI                   |
| `/permissions`       | Permission management is interactive                       |
| `/memory`            | Memory/CLAUDE.md editing requires TUI                      |
| `/rewind`            | Conversation rewind requires interactive selection         |
| `/vim`               | Vim mode is a TUI feature                                  |
| `/doctor`            | Diagnostics run as a separate CLI command                  |
| `/login` / `/logout` | Authentication is interactive                              |
| `/bug`               | Bug reporting requires interactive input                   |

<Tip>
For commands like `/mcp` or `/config`, use the Claude Code CLI directly in a terminal: `claude mcp` or `claude config`.
</Tip>
