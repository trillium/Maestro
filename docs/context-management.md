| **Mark as Unread**                  | Yes              | Add unread indicator to the tab                                          |
| **Export as HTML**                  | No (1+ logs)     | Export conversation as self-contained HTML file                          |
| **Context: Copy to Clipboard**      | No (1+ logs)     | Copy the full conversation to clipboard                                  |
| **Context: Compact**                | No (5+ logs)     | Compress context while preserving key information                        |

| **Move to First Position**          | No               | Move this tab to the first position                                      |
| **Move to Last Position**           | No               | Move this tab to the last position                                       |

### Tab Close Operations

The tab menu also provides bulk close operations for managing multiple tabs:

![Tab Close - Center Tab](./screenshots/tab-close-center.png)

| Action                      | Description                             |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Close**                   | Close the current tab                   |
| **Close Others**            | Close all tabs except this one          |
| **Close Tabs to the Left**  | Close all tabs to the left of this one  |
| **Close Tabs to the Right** | Close all tabs to the right of this one |

These operations respect the **Unread Filter**: when the filter is active, only visible tabs are affected - hidden "read" tabs are preserved.

**Position-aware options:** The menu intelligently hides inapplicable options:

- First tab: "Close Tabs to the Left" is disabled
- Last tab: "Close Tabs to the Right" is disabled
- Single tab: "Close" and "Close Others" are disabled

![Tab Close - Left Tab](./screenshots/tab-close-left.png)
![Tab Close - Right Tab](./screenshots/tab-close-right.png)

All close operations support **undo** - press `Cmd+Shift+T` / `Ctrl+Shift+T` to reopen recently closed tabs (up to 25 tabs are remembered).

These actions are also available via **Quick Actions** (`Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`) with keyboard shortcuts displayed:

## Tab Export

Export any tab conversation as a self-contained HTML file:

1. Hover over the tab → **Export as HTML**
2. Choose a save location when prompted

The exported HTML file includes:

- **Full conversation history** with all messages
- **Your current theme colors** - the export adopts your active Maestro theme
- **Maestro branding** with links to the website and GitHub
- **Session metadata** - agent type, working directory, timestamps, token usage
- **Rendered markdown** - code blocks, tables, and formatting preserved

This is useful for sharing conversations, creating documentation, or archiving important sessions.

**Alternative sharing options:**

- **Context: Copy to Clipboard** - Copy the raw conversation text to clipboard (for pasting into documents or chat)
- **Context: Publish as GitHub Gist** - Share as a public or secret GitHub Gist (requires `gh` CLI to be installed)

Context management lets you combine or transfer conversation history between sessions and agents, enabling powerful workflows where you can:

- **Compact & continue** - Compress your context to stay within token limits while preserving key information
- **Merge sessions** - Combine context from multiple conversations into one
- **Transfer to other agents** - Send your context to a different AI agent (e.g., Claude Code → Codex)

## Context Window Warnings

As your conversation grows, Maestro monitors context window usage and displays warnings when you're approaching limits.

![Context Warning Banner](./screenshots/context-warnings.png)

The warning banner appears below the input box showing:

- Current context usage percentage
- **Compact & Continue** button for one-click context compression

### Why Context Usage Matters

**Operating near context limits degrades AI performance.** When context reaches ~80% capacity or higher:

- The AI loses access to earlier parts of your conversation
- Important decisions, code changes, and context get pushed out
- Response quality drops as the model struggles to maintain coherence
- You may experience more hallucinations and forgotten instructions

For best results, **compact your context before reaching 60-70% usage** - don't wait for the red warning.

### Configuring Warnings

Customize warning thresholds in **Settings** (`Cmd+,` / `Ctrl+,`) → **Display** → **Context Window Warnings**:

![Context Warning Configuration](./screenshots/context-warnings-config.png)

| Setting                               | Default | Description                                         |
| ------------------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Show context consumption warnings** | Enabled | Toggle warning banners on/off                       |
| **Yellow warning threshold**          | 60%     | Early warning - good time to consider compacting    |
| **Red warning threshold**             | 80%     | Critical - compact immediately to avoid degradation |

**Recommended thresholds:**

- Set yellow to **50-60%** if you prefer earlier warnings
- Set red to **70-80%** - going higher risks quality degradation
- Lower both thresholds if you frequently work on complex tasks that require the AI to remember many details

## Compact & Continue

When your conversation approaches context limits, you can compress it while preserving essential information:

1. **Hover over** a tab → **"Context: Compact"**, or use **Command Palette** (`Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`) → "Context: Compact"
2. The AI compacts the conversation, extracting key decisions, code changes, and context
3. A new tab opens with the compressed context, ready to continue working

**When to use:**

- The context warning sash appears (yellow at 60%, red at 80% usage)
- You want to continue a long conversation without losing important context
- You need to free up context space for new tasks

**What gets preserved:**

- Key decisions and their rationale
- Code changes and file modifications
- Important technical details and constraints
- Current task state and next steps

### How Compaction Works

Compaction uses a multi-pass approach to handle conversations of any size:

**Eligibility Check:**
Compaction requires any one of these conditions:

- Context usage ≥ 25% (as reported by the agent), OR
- Estimated conversation size ≥ 2,000 tokens (~8k characters), OR
- At least 8 meaningful messages (user and AI exchanges)

Multiple fallbacks ensure compaction is available even when the context gauge resets to 0 (which can happen when context fills up) - as long as there's meaningful conversation history, you can compact it.

**Single-Pass Compaction (< 50k tokens):**
For smaller conversations, the entire context is sent to a fresh AI agent in batch mode, which returns a compressed summary.

**Chunked Compaction (≥ 50k tokens):**
For larger conversations that exceed 50,000 tokens:

1. **Chunking** - The conversation is split into chunks of ~50k tokens each
2. **Parallel summarization** - Each chunk is sent to a separate batch-mode agent process
3. **Combination** - Chunk summaries are combined together
4. **Consolidation** - If the combined result exceeds 40k tokens, additional passes reduce it further

**Consolidation Passes:**
When chunk summaries combine to more than 40k tokens, the system performs up to 3 consolidation passes:

- Each pass asks the AI to aggressively reduce the summary while preserving key information
- A pass is only accepted if it reduces size by at least 10%
- Consolidation stops early if no meaningful reduction is achieved

This ensures that even a conversation at 95%+ context capacity (e.g., 190k tokens) will be compacted to a manageable size (~40k tokens or less) that leaves room for continued work.

**Progress Indicators:**
During compaction, you'll see status updates:

- "Extracting context..." - Preparing the conversation
- "Summarizing chunk 1/4..." - Processing large conversations in parts
- "Consolidation pass 1/3..." - Additional reduction passes if needed
- "Finalizing compacted context..." - Creating the new tab

## Merging Sessions

Combine context from multiple sessions or tabs into one:

1. **Hover over** a tab → **"Context: Merge Into"**, or use **Command Palette** (`Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`) → "Context: Merge Into"
2. Search for or select the target session/tab from the modal
3. Review the merge preview showing estimated token count
4. Optionally enable **Clean context** to remove duplicates and reduce size
5. Click **"Merge Into"**

![Merge Modal](./screenshots/tab-merge.png)

The modal shows:

- **Paste ID** tab - Enter a specific session ID directly
- **Open Tabs** tab - Browse all open tabs across all agents
- **Token estimate** - Shows source size and estimated size after cleaning
- **Agent grouping** - Tabs organized by agent with tab counts

The merged context creates a new tab in the target session with conversation history from both sources. Use this to consolidate related conversations or bring context from an older session into a current one.

**What gets merged:**

- Full conversation history (user messages and AI responses)
- Token estimates are shown before merge to help you stay within context limits

**Tips:**

- You can merge tabs within the same session or across different sessions
- Large merges (100k+ tokens) will show a warning but still proceed
- Self-merge (same tab to itself) is prevented
- Enable "Clean context" for large merges to reduce token count

## Sending to Another Agent

Transfer your context to a different AI agent:

1. **Hover over** a tab → **"Context: Send to Agent"**, or use **Command Palette** (`Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`) → "Context: Send to Agent"
2. Search for or select the target agent from the list
3. Review the token estimate and cleaning options
4. Click **"Send to Session"**

![Send to Agent Modal](./screenshots/tab-send.png)

The modal shows:

- **Searchable agent list** with status indicators (Idle, Busy, etc.)
- **Agent paths** to distinguish between agents with similar names
- **Token estimate** - Shows source size and estimated size after cleaning
- **Clean context option** - Remove duplicates and reduce size before transfer

**Context Cleaning:**
When transferring between agents, the context can be automatically cleaned to:

- Remove duplicate messages and verbose output
- Condense while preserving key information
- Optimize token usage for the target session

Cleaning is enabled by default but can be disabled for verbatim transfers.

**Use Cases:**

- Start a task in Claude Code, then hand off to Codex for a different perspective
- Transfer a debugging session to an agent with different tool access
- Move context to an agent pointing at a different project directory
- Share context with a worktree sub-agent working on the same codebase
