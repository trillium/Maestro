Maestro hones fractured attention into focused intent. It is built for developers who need to coordinate multiple AI agents, repositories, and long-running tasks without leaving a keyboard-first workflow.

## Spec-Driven Workflow

Maestro enables a **specification-first approach** to AI-assisted development. Instead of ad-hoc prompting, you collaboratively build detailed specs with the AI, then execute them systematically:

1. **PLAN** - Discuss the feature with the AI agent
2. **SPECIFY** - Create markdown docs with task checklists in the Auto Run document folder
3. **EXECUTE** - Auto Run works through tasks, spawning a fresh session per task
4. **REFINE** - Review results, update specs, and repeat

**Why this works:**

- **Deliberate planning** - Conversation forces you to think through requirements before coding
- **Documented specs** - Your markdown files become living documentation
- **Clean execution** - Each task runs in isolation with no context bleed
- **Iterative refinement** - Review, adjust specs, re-run - specs evolve with your understanding

**Example workflow:**

1. **Plan**: In the AI Terminal, discuss your feature: _"I want to add user authentication with OAuth support"_
2. **Specify**: Ask the AI to help create a spec: _"Create a markdown checklist for implementing this feature"_
3. **Save**: Copy the spec to your Auto Run document folder (or have the AI write it directly)
4. **Execute**: Switch to Auto Run tab, select the doc, click Run - Maestro handles the rest
5. **Review**: Check the History tab for results, refine specs as needed

This approach mirrors methodologies like [Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit), but with a graphical interface, real-time AI collaboration, and multi-agent parallelism.

## Key Concepts

| Concept                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent**                 | A Maestro workspace tied to a project directory, backed by a provider (Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode). Each agent has a Command Terminal and AI Terminal.                                                                                                      |
| **Provider**              | The underlying AI coding assistant (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, or OpenCode) that powers an agent.                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Session / Tab**         | A conversation with the AI provider. Sessions and tabs are 1:1 - each tab represents one session. Agents can have multiple tabs for parallel conversations.                                                                                                      |
| **Group**                 | Organizational container for agents. Group by project, client, or workflow.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Group Chat**            | Multi-agent conversation coordinated by a moderator. Ask questions across multiple agents and get synthesized answers.                                                                                                                                           |
| **Git Worktree**          | An isolated working directory linked to a separate branch. Worktree sub-agents appear nested under their parent in the agent list and can create PRs.                                                                                                            |
| **AI Terminal**           | The conversation interface with your AI provider. Supports `@` file mentions, slash commands, and image attachments.                                                                                                                                             |
| **Command Terminal**      | A PTY shell for running commands directly. Tab completion for files, git branches, and command history.                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Session Explorer**      | Browse all past sessions for an agent. Star, rename, search, and resume any previous conversation.                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Auto Run**              | Automated task runner that processes markdown checklists. Spawns a fresh session per task.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Playbook**              | A saved collection of Auto Run documents with document order, options, and settings for repeatable workflows.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **History**               | Timestamped log of all actions (user commands, AI responses, Auto Run completions) with session links.                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Remote Control**        | Web interface for mobile access. Local network or remote via Cloudflare tunnel.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **CLI**                   | Headless command-line tool for scripting, automation, and CI/CD integration.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Provider Pass-Through** | Maestro delegates all AI work to your installed provider (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode). Your MCP tools, custom skills, permissions, and authentication all carry over - Maestro runs them in batch mode (prompt in, response out) rather than interactive mode. |
