Maestro ships with 23 core system prompts that control wizard conversations, Auto Run behavior, group chat moderation, context management, and more - plus a library of reusable **include** fragments (Auto Run spec, CLI reference, Cue model, file-access rules, etc.) that other prompts reference. Every prompt is a Markdown template you can edit, and changes take effect immediately - no restart required.

## Opening the Prompt Editor

![Maestro Prompts settings tab](./screenshots/settings-prompts.png)

1. Open **Settings** (`Cmd+,` / `Ctrl+,`)
2. Select the **Maestro Prompts** tab
3. Browse prompts by category in the left sidebar - each row shows an estimated token count so you can spot heavy prompts at a glance
4. Edit in the right-side editor, then click **Save**. A live token estimate next to the prompt title updates as you type.

You can also jump to the four most commonly edited prompts from **Quick Actions** (`Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`): Maestro System Prompt, Auto Run Default, Commit Command, and Group Chat Moderator.

<Tip>
Click the expand button (top-right of the editor) to give the editor the full width of the settings panel. Click the help button for an inline reference of all categories and template variables.

## Prompt Categories

Prompts are organized by the feature they control:

| Category          | What It Controls                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Wizard**        | The planning wizard for Auto Run documents - system prompt, continuation flow, and document generation                                                     |
| **Inline Wizard** | The inline wizard that operates within the editor - new sessions, iteration, and generation                                                                |
| **Auto Run**      | Auto Run behavior - the default execution prompt and synopsis generation                                                                                   |
| **Group Chat**    | Group chat sessions - moderator system/synthesis prompts, participant behavior, and participant request formatting                                         |
| **Context**       | Context window management - grooming (trimming), transferring between sessions, and summarization                                                          |
| **Commands**      | Built-in commands - image-only message handling and git commit message generation                                                                          |
| **System**        | Core system behavior - the Maestro system prompt injected into agents, tab naming, Director's Notes, and feedback                                          |
| **Includes**      | Reusable fragments (filenames begin with `_`) referenced from other prompts via `{{INCLUDE:name}}` or `{{REF:name}}` - never sent to an agent on their own |

## Include Directives

Maestro composes prompts at assembly time using two directives. Both reference the same library of fragments - the difference is whether the content is delivered up-front or fetched on demand.

### `{{INCLUDE:name}}` - full inlining

Embeds the contents of another prompt file directly into the parent. Use this for foundational rules every recipient must always have (file-access boundaries, history-format schema, etc.).

```markdown
## Your Role

You are an expert code reviewer.

{{INCLUDE:maestro-system-prompt}}

## Task-Specific Instructions

Review the code changes below...
```

### `{{REF:name}}` - pointer-style (progressive disclosure)

Replaces the directive with a single-line bullet that names the include, summarizes its content, and tells the agent how to fetch it on demand:

```markdown
- **`_maestro-cue`** - Cue event types, YAML config, template variables, and CLI hooks. Fetch with `maestro-cli prompts get _maestro-cue`.
```

The agent then runs `maestro-cli prompts get _maestro-cue` only if the task actually needs that detail. This keeps the parent prompt small and pushes heavy reference material out of the default context.

Use `{{REF:}}` for bulky reference material (CLI surface, Cue model, playbook spec, doc index) that only some sessions need, and `{{INCLUDE:}}` for short, must-always-have content.

### Discovering and Fetching Includes from the CLI

```bash
# List every available prompt id with description and category
maestro-cli prompts list

# Fetch a single prompt's content (honors any user customizations)
maestro-cli prompts get _maestro-cli
maestro-cli prompts get _maestro-cue --json   # adds metadata
```

The `prompts get` command returns the same content the desktop app would deliver, so an agent following a `{{REF:}}` pointer always sees your latest customizations.

### How Resolution Works

The two directives use slightly different lookup paths.

**`{{INCLUDE:name}}`** resolves in this order:

1. Maestro first checks the **prompt cache** - any core prompt (bundled or customized) can be referenced by its id (e.g., `maestro-system-prompt`, `_maestro-cli`).
2. If not found in cache, Maestro looks for a **file on disk** at `<prompts-directory>/<name>.md`.

This means you can create your own reusable prompt fragments by placing `.md` files in the prompts directory (click **Open Folder** in the editor to find it), then reference them from any core prompt with `{{INCLUDE:name}}`.

**`{{REF:name}}`** only resolves names that are in the core prompt registry. The expansion uses the registered description, so the directive needs metadata that on-disk-only fragments don't have. To use `{{REF:}}` with your own content, edit one of the existing core prompts (e.g., add an `_includes` of your own to the registry by extending the codebase) or stick with `{{INCLUDE:}}` for ad-hoc fragments.

### Rules

- **Naming convention**: Bundled include fragments use a leading underscore (e.g., `_maestro-cli.md`, `_history-format.md`). Your own fragments can use any name; the underscore is purely a visual signal that the file is meant to be referenced rather than used standalone.
- **Resolution order**: `{{REF:}}` directives are expanded first (they consult the in-memory prompt registry only), then `{{INCLUDE:}}` directives are inlined recursively against cache + disk.
- **Max depth**: `{{INCLUDE:}}` nests up to 3 levels deep. Beyond that, the directive is left as-is.
- **Circular references**: If prompt A includes B which includes A, the cycle is detected and the second inclusion is skipped.
- **Missing references**: If a name can't be resolved, the directive text is left unchanged in the output.
- **Case-sensitive**: The name must match exactly (e.g., `{{INCLUDE:my-fragment}}` looks for `my-fragment` in cache or `my-fragment.md` on disk).
- **Refs are non-recursive**: A `{{REF:name}}` always expands to a literal pointer line; the resolver does not chase further directives inside the referenced file.

### Creating Reusable Fragments

You can create your own prompt fragments that aren't part of the core set:

1. Click **Open Folder** in the prompt editor to open the prompts directory.
2. Create a new `.md` file (e.g., `_my-coding-standards.md` - leading underscore optional but recommended for fragments).
3. Write your reusable content.
4. Reference it from any core prompt with `{{INCLUDE:_my-coding-standards}}`.

This is useful for shared instructions you want injected into multiple prompts - coding standards, project context, team conventions, response formatting rules, etc. (`{{REF:}}` only works against the bundled registry - use `{{INCLUDE:}}` for your own files.)

<Info>
Custom fragment files in the prompts directory are not shown in the editor's category list - they're referenced via `{{INCLUDE:name}}` only. Core prompts are the ones you browse and edit in the sidebar.
</Info>

## Resetting Prompts

Click **Reset to Default** on any prompt to restore the bundled version. This removes your customization and takes effect immediately.

Customizations are stored in a separate file (`core-prompts-customizations.json` in your Maestro data directory) and survive app updates. Only prompts you've explicitly edited are stored - everything else uses the bundled defaults.

## Tips

- **Start small**: Try editing the `maestro-system-prompt` first - it's the system context injected into every agent session and has the highest impact.
- **Use includes for shared context**: If you want the same instructions in multiple prompts, create a fragment file and use `{{INCLUDE:name}}` rather than duplicating text.
- **Use refs for big optional context**: When the shared content is bulky and only some sessions need it (CLI reference, Cue model, playbook spec), use `{{REF:name}}` instead of `{{INCLUDE:name}}` so the parent prompt stays small and the agent can self-fetch via `maestro-cli prompts get <name>`.
- **Test with Quick Actions**: The four most common prompts are accessible from `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K` for fast iteration.
- **Variables are case-insensitive**: `{{date}}` and `{{DATE}}` both work, but uppercase is conventional.
- **Autocomplete helps**: Type `{{` in the editor and browse all available variables with descriptions. No need to memorize them.
