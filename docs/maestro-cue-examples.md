Complete, copy-paste-ready `.maestro/cue.yaml` configurations for common workflows. Each example is self-contained - drop it into your project's `.maestro/` directory and adjust agent names to match your Left Bar.

## Pipeline Grouping

Group related automations under a single pipeline - multiple trigger lines appear as one pipeline in the Pipeline Editor instead of cluttering the dropdown.

```yaml
# Pipeline: Monitoring (color: #06b6d4)

subscriptions:
  # Daily scan - runs every morning
  - name: Monitoring
    label: Daily Scan
    event: time.scheduled
    schedule_times:
      - '06:00'
    schedule_days:
      - mon
      - tue
      - wed
      - thu
      - fri
      - sat
      - sun
    prompt: |
      Run the daily monitoring workflow:
      1. Scan for new activity
      2. Compare against yesterday's snapshot
      3. Generate a briefing in journal/{{DATE}}.md

  # Weekly review - runs Sunday mornings
  - name: Monitoring-chain-1
    label: Weekly Review
    event: time.scheduled
    schedule_times:
      - '08:00'
    schedule_days:
      - sun
    prompt: |
      Generate a weekly performance review.
      Summarize activity, highlight trends, and flag issues.

settings:
  timeout_minutes: 45
  max_concurrent: 1
```

**How it works:**

1. The `# Pipeline: Monitoring (color: #06b6d4)` comment declares the pipeline name and UI color
2. The first subscription's `name` matches the pipeline name (`Monitoring`)
3. Additional subscriptions use `Name-chain-N` (e.g., `Monitoring-chain-1`)
4. The `label` field gives each line a descriptive name in the UI

Both subscriptions appear as trigger lines within a single **Monitoring** pipeline. Each can have its own event type, schedule, and prompt.

---

## Workspace Initialization

Run setup tasks once when the Maestro application launches - install dependencies, verify environment, run health checks.

**Agents needed:** `setup-agent`

```yaml
subscriptions:
  - name: init-workspace
    event: app.startup
    prompt: |
      Initialize the workspace:
      1. Run `npm install` if node_modules is missing or outdated
      2. Verify required environment variables are set
      3. Run `npm run build` to ensure the project compiles
      Report any issues found.
```

This fires exactly once per application launch. Toggling Cue off and back on does NOT re-fire it. Only an application restart triggers it again. Editing the YAML does not re-trigger it.

---

## CI-Style Pipeline

Lint, test, and deploy in sequence. Each step only runs if the previous one succeeded.

**Agents needed:** `linter`, `tester`, `deployer`

<Note>
This example assumes each agent has its own project root and therefore its own `.maestro/cue.yaml`. The three files below live under three different project roots - that's the supported pattern for multi-root pipelines (the engine reads each agent's own cue.yaml and never aggregates across roots). See [Multi-root pipelines](./maestro-cue-configuration#multi-root-pipelines-agents-in-different-project-roots) for the full rule. If all three agents share one project root, put all three subscriptions in a single `.maestro/cue.yaml` and use `agent_id` (or `settings.owner_agent_id` plus an explicit `agent_id` per sub) to route each one.
</Note>

The `linter` agent's `.maestro/cue.yaml`:

```yaml
subscriptions:
  - name: lint-on-save
    event: file.changed
    watch: 'src/**/*.{ts,tsx}'
    prompt: |
      Run `npx eslint {{CUE_FILE_PATH}} --fix`.
      Report any errors that couldn't be auto-fixed.
```

The `tester` agent's `.maestro/cue.yaml`:

```yaml
subscriptions:
  - name: test-after-lint
    event: agent.completed
    source_session: 'linter'
    filter:
      status: completed
      exitCode: 0
    prompt: |
      Lint passed. Run `npm test` and report results.
```

The `deployer` agent's `.maestro/cue.yaml`:

```yaml
subscriptions:
  - name: deploy-after-tests
    event: agent.completed
    source_session: 'tester'
    filter:
      status: completed
      exitCode: 0
    prompt: |
      Tests passed. Deploy to staging with `npm run deploy:staging`.
```

---

## Scheduled Automation

Run prompts at specific times and days using `time.scheduled`. Unlike `time.heartbeat` (which fires every N minutes), scheduled triggers fire at exact clock times.

**Agent needed:** `ops`

```yaml
subscriptions:
  # Morning standup report on weekdays
  - name: morning-standup
    event: time.scheduled
    schedule_times:
      - '09:00'
    schedule_days:
      - mon
      - tue
      - wed
      - thu
      - fri
    prompt: |
      Generate a standup report:
      1. Run `git log --oneline --since="yesterday"` for recent changes
      2. Check for any open PRs needing review
      3. Summarize what was done and what's next

  # End-of-day summary at 5 PM on weekdays
  - name: eod-summary
    event: time.scheduled
    schedule_times:
      - '17:00'
    schedule_days:
      - mon
      - tue
      - wed
      - thu
      - fri
    prompt: |
      Generate an end-of-day summary with today's commits and open items.

  # Weekend maintenance at midnight Saturday
  - name: weekend-maintenance
    event: time.scheduled
    schedule_times:
      - '00:00'
    schedule_days:
      - sat
    prompt: |
      Run maintenance tasks:
      1. Clean up old build artifacts
      2. Update dependencies with `npm outdated`
      3. Generate a dependency report
```

---

## Selective Chaining with triggeredBy

When an agent has multiple subscriptions but only one should chain to another agent, use the `triggeredBy` filter. This field contains the subscription name that triggered the completing run.

**Agents needed:** `worker` (has multiple cue subscriptions), `reviewer`

The `worker` agent's `.maestro/cue.yaml`:

```yaml
subscriptions:
  # This one should NOT trigger the reviewer
  - name: routine-cleanup
    event: time.heartbeat
    interval_minutes: 60
    prompt: Run `npm run clean` and remove stale build artifacts.

  # This one should NOT trigger the reviewer either
  - name: lint-check
    event: file.changed
    watch: 'src/**/*.ts'
    prompt: Lint {{CUE_FILE_PATH}}.

  # Only THIS one should trigger the reviewer
  - name: implement-feature
    event: github.issue
    filter:
      labels: 'enhancement'
    prompt: |
      New feature request: {{CUE_GH_TITLE}} (#{{CUE_GH_NUMBER}})
      {{CUE_GH_BODY}}

      Implement this feature following existing patterns.
```

The `reviewer` agent's `.maestro/cue.yaml`:

```yaml
subscriptions:
  - name: review-new-feature
    event: agent.completed
    source_session: 'worker'
    filter:
      triggeredBy: 'implement-feature' # Only chains from this specific subscription
      status: completed
    prompt: |
      The worker just implemented a feature. Review the changes:

      {{CUE_SOURCE_OUTPUT}}

      Check for:
      1. Code quality and consistency
      2. Missing test coverage
      3. Documentation gaps
```

The `triggeredBy` filter also supports glob patterns: `triggeredBy: "implement-*"` matches any subscription name starting with `implement-`.

---

## Research Swarm

Fan out a question to multiple agents, then fan in to synthesize results.

**Agents needed:** `coordinator`, `researcher-a`, `researcher-b`, `researcher-c`

The `coordinator` agent's `.maestro/cue.yaml`:

```yaml
subscriptions:
  # Fan-out: send the research question to all researchers
  - name: dispatch-research
    event: file.changed
    watch: 'research-question.md'
    fan_out:
      - 'researcher-a'
      - 'researcher-b'
      - 'researcher-c'
    prompt: |
      Research the following question from different angles.
      File: {{CUE_FILE_PATH}}

      Read the file and provide a thorough analysis.

  # Fan-in: synthesize when all researchers finish
  - name: synthesize-results
    event: agent.completed
    source_session:
      - 'researcher-a'
      - 'researcher-b'
      - 'researcher-c'
    prompt: |
      All researchers have completed their analysis.

      Combined outputs:
      {{CUE_SOURCE_OUTPUT}}

      Synthesize these perspectives into a single coherent report.
      Highlight agreements, contradictions, and key insights.

settings:
  timeout_minutes: 60
  timeout_on_fail: continue # Synthesize with partial results if someone times out
```

---

## PR Review with Targeted Follow-Up

Auto-review new PRs, then selectively notify a security reviewer only for PRs that touch auth code.

**Agents needed:** `pr-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`

The `pr-reviewer` agent's `.maestro/cue.yaml`:

```yaml
subscriptions:
  - name: review-all-prs
    event: github.pull_request
    poll_minutes: 3
    filter:
      draft: false
      base_branch: main
    prompt: |
      New PR: {{CUE_GH_TITLE}} (#{{CUE_GH_NUMBER}})
      Author: {{CUE_GH_AUTHOR}}
      Branch: {{CUE_GH_BRANCH}} -> {{CUE_GH_BASE_BRANCH}}
      URL: {{CUE_GH_URL}}

      {{CUE_GH_BODY}}

      Review for code quality, bugs, and style.
      In your output, list all files changed.
```

The `security-reviewer` agent's `.maestro/cue.yaml`:

```yaml
subscriptions:
  - name: security-review
    event: agent.completed
    source_session: 'pr-reviewer'
    filter:
      triggeredBy: 'review-all-prs'
      status: completed
    prompt: |
      A PR was just reviewed. Check if any auth/security-sensitive files were changed:

      {{CUE_SOURCE_OUTPUT}}

      If auth, session, or permission-related code was modified:
      1. Audit the changes for security vulnerabilities
      2. Check for injection, XSS, or auth bypass risks
      3. Verify proper input validation

      If no security-sensitive files were changed, respond with "No security review needed."
```

---

## TODO Task Queue

Watch a markdown file for unchecked tasks and work through them sequentially.

**Agents needed:** `task-worker`

```yaml
subscriptions:
  - name: work-todos
    event: task.pending
    watch: 'TODO.md'
    poll_minutes: 2
    filter:
      taskCount: '>=1'
    prompt: |
      There are {{CUE_TASK_COUNT}} pending tasks in {{CUE_TASK_FILE}}:

      {{CUE_TASK_LIST}}

      Pick the FIRST unchecked task and complete it.
      When done, change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` in the file.
      Do NOT work on more than one task at a time.

settings:
  max_concurrent: 1 # Serial execution - one task at a time
```

---

## Multi-Environment Deploy

Fan out deployments to staging, production, and docs after a build passes.

**Agents needed:** `builder`, `deploy-staging`, `deploy-prod`, `deploy-docs`

The `builder` agent's `.maestro/cue.yaml`:

```yaml
subscriptions:
  - name: build-on-push
    event: file.changed
    watch: 'src/**/*'
    prompt: |
      Source files changed. Run a full build with `npm run build`.
      Report success or failure.
```

Any agent with visibility to `builder` (e.g., `deploy-staging`):

```yaml
subscriptions:
  - name: fan-out-deploy
    event: agent.completed
    source_session: 'builder'
    filter:
      triggeredBy: 'build-on-push'
      exitCode: 0
    fan_out:
      - 'deploy-staging'
      - 'deploy-prod'
      - 'deploy-docs'
    prompt: |
      Build succeeded. Deploy your target environment.
      Build output: {{CUE_SOURCE_OUTPUT}}
```

---

## Issue Triage Bot

Auto-triage new GitHub issues by labeling and assigning them.

**Agents needed:** `triage-bot`

```yaml
subscriptions:
  - name: triage-issues
    event: github.issue
    poll_minutes: 5
    filter:
      state: open
      labels: '!triaged' # Skip already-triaged issues
    prompt: |
      New issue needs triage: {{CUE_GH_TITLE}} (#{{CUE_GH_NUMBER}})
      Author: {{CUE_GH_AUTHOR}}
      Labels: {{CUE_GH_LABELS}}

      {{CUE_GH_BODY}}

      Triage this issue:
      1. Identify the component/area affected
      2. Estimate complexity (small / medium / large)
      3. Suggest priority (P0-P3)
      4. Recommend an assignee based on the area
      5. Run `gh issue edit {{CUE_GH_NUMBER}} --add-label "triaged"` to mark as triaged
```

---

## Debate Pattern

Two agents analyze a problem independently, then a third synthesizes their perspectives.

**Agents needed:** `advocate`, `critic`, `judge`

The config that triggers the debate (on any agent with visibility):

```yaml
subscriptions:
  - name: start-debate
    event: file.changed
    watch: 'debate-topic.md'
    fan_out:
      - 'advocate'
      - 'critic'
    prompt: |
      Read {{CUE_FILE_PATH}} and analyze the proposal.

      You are assigned a role - argue from that perspective:
      - advocate: argue IN FAVOR, highlight benefits and opportunities
      - critic: argue AGAINST, highlight risks and weaknesses

      Be thorough and specific.
```

The `judge` agent's `.maestro/cue.yaml`:

```yaml
subscriptions:
  - name: synthesize-debate
    event: agent.completed
    source_session:
      - 'advocate'
      - 'critic'
    prompt: |
      Both sides of the debate have been presented.

      Arguments:
      {{CUE_SOURCE_OUTPUT}}

      As the judge:
      1. Summarize each side's strongest points
      2. Identify where they agree and disagree
      3. Render a verdict with your reasoning
      4. Propose a path forward that addresses both perspectives

settings:
  timeout_minutes: 45
  timeout_on_fail: continue
```

---

## Scheduled Report with Conditional Chain

Generate an hourly report, but only notify a summary agent when there's meaningful activity.

**Agents needed:** `reporter`, `summarizer`

The `reporter` agent's `.maestro/cue.yaml`:

```yaml
subscriptions:
  - name: hourly-git-report
    event: time.heartbeat
    interval_minutes: 60
    prompt: |
      Generate a report of git activity in the last hour.
      Run `git log --oneline --since="1 hour ago"`.

      If there are commits, format them as a structured report.
      If there are no commits, respond with exactly: "NO_ACTIVITY"
```

The `summarizer` agent's `.maestro/cue.yaml`:

```yaml
subscriptions:
  - name: summarize-activity
    event: agent.completed
    source_session: 'reporter'
    filter:
      triggeredBy: 'hourly-git-report'
      status: completed
    prompt: |
      The hourly reporter just finished. Here's its output:

      {{CUE_SOURCE_OUTPUT}}

      If the output says "NO_ACTIVITY", respond with "Nothing to summarize."
      Otherwise, create a concise executive summary of the development activity.
```

---

## CLI-Triggered Code Review

Set up an on-demand code review that agents or CI can trigger from the command line.

**Agents needed:** `reviewer`

The `reviewer` agent's `.maestro/cue.yaml`:

```yaml
subscriptions:
  - name: code-review
    event: cli.trigger
    label: Code Review
    prompt: |
      Review the current git diff and provide feedback.

      {{CUE_CLI_PROMPT}}

      Steps:
      1. Run `git diff` to see the changes
      2. Check for correctness, security issues, and style
      3. Summarize what changed and flag any concerns
    enabled: true
```

**Triggering:**

```bash
# Basic review using the configured prompt
maestro-cli cue trigger code-review

# Review with specific focus
maestro-cli cue trigger code-review --prompt "Focus on the auth module changes"
```

---

## CI/CD Deploy Pipeline

Trigger a deploy from CI or scripts, passing the environment as the prompt.

**Agents needed:** `deployer`

The `deployer` agent's `.maestro/cue.yaml`:

```yaml
subscriptions:
  - name: deploy
    event: cli.trigger
    label: Deploy
    prompt: |
      Deploy the current branch.
      Target: {{CUE_CLI_PROMPT}}

      1. Run the test suite
      2. Build the project
      3. Deploy to the specified environment
      4. Verify the deployment is healthy
    enabled: true

  - name: post-deploy-verify
    event: agent.completed
    source_session: 'deployer'
    filter:
      triggeredBy: 'deploy'
      status: completed
    prompt: |
      The deploy just finished. Run smoke tests and verify the deployment is healthy.
      Report any issues immediately.
```

**Triggering from CI:**

```bash
# From a CI pipeline
maestro-cli cue trigger deploy --prompt "staging" --json

# From a release script
maestro-cli cue trigger deploy --prompt "production"
```
