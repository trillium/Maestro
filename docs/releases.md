## v0.16.x - Maestro Cue

**Latest: v0.16.6-RC** | In Development

### New Features

- **Maestro Cue** — Event-driven automation engine that watches for file changes, time intervals, agent completions, GitHub PRs/issues, and pending markdown tasks to trigger automated prompts. Configured via `.maestro/cue.yaml` per project. Gated as an Encore Feature
- **Environment tab** — Dedicated Settings tab for managing global environment variables passed to all agents
- **Static history graph with viewport indicator** — The activity graph in the History panel no longer shifts as you scroll; instead, a sliding indicator line with a timestamp label shows your current position in the timeline
- **File preview tab filtering** — New setting to control whether file preview tabs remain visible when the unread filter is active, with a redesigned Tab Filtering section in Display settings
- **Cloudflare tunnel auto-restart** — The web/mobile tunnel automatically restarts when the web server port changes
- **Custom TTS notifications** — Synopsis text is now sent to custom notification commands for user-initiated tasks

### Bug Fixes

- **Auto Run document clarity** — Rewrote the Auto Run instructions in the system prompt for improved agent comprehension
- **openExternal guard** — Prevented relative paths from being passed to `shell.openExternal`, suppressing RangeError noise

## v0.15.x - Maestro Symphony

**Latest: v0.15.3** | Released April 5, 2026

### Major 0.15.x Additions

🎶 **Maestro Symphony** — Contribute to open source with AI assistance! Browse curated issues from open-source projects with the `runmaestro.ai` label, clone repos with one click, and automatically process the relevant Auto Run playbooks. Track your contributions, streaks, and stats. You're contributing CPU and tokens towards your favorite open-source projects and features.

🎬 **Director's Notes** — Aggregates history across all agents into a unified timeline with search, filters, and an activity graph. Includes an AI Overview tab that generates a structured synopsis of recent work. Off by default, gated behind a new "Encore Features" panel under settings. This is a precursor to an eventual plugin system, allowing for extensions and customizations without bloating the core app.

🏷️ **Conductor Profile** — Available under Settings > General. Provide a short description on how Maestro agents should interface with you.

🧠 **Three-State Thinking Toggle** — The thinking toggle now cycles through three modes: off, on, and sticky. Sticky mode keeps thinking content visible after the response completes. Cycle with CMD/CTRL+SHIFT+K.

🤖 **Factory.ai Droid Support** — Added support for the [Factory.ai](https://factory.ai/product/cli) droid agent. Full session management and output parsing integration.

## Changes in v0.15.3

- **CLI settings management:** Full `maestro-cli settings` command suite — list, get, set, and reset any Maestro setting from the command line. Includes per-agent configuration (custom paths, args, env vars, model overrides). Supports category filtering, verbose descriptions, and machine-readable JSON output for scripting
- **Live settings reload:** Settings changes made via the CLI are automatically detected by the running desktop app — no restart required
- **Plan-Mode toggle:** Claude Code and OpenCode agents now show "Plan-Mode" instead of "Read-Only" for the read-only toggle, matching their native terminology
- **Solarized Dark theme:** New Solarized Dark color theme with tuned contrast for tags, code blocks, and pill labels
- **Files pane icon theme:** Choose between default and rich icon themes in the files pane — rich theme adds colorful, language-specific icons for 70+ file types and folder categories. Toggle under Settings > Display
- **Persistent web link:** The web/mobile interface link now persists across app restarts — no need to re-enable it each session
- **OpenCode v1.2+ session support:** Automatically reads OpenCode's new SQLite session storage format alongside the legacy JSONL format
- **Group chat @mentions:** Use `@agent-name` syntax in the prompt composer to direct messages to specific agents in group chat
- **Group chat over SSH:** Group chat synthesis and moderation now run correctly on SSH remote agents instead of always spawning locally
- **Group chat participant management:** Remove button on participant cards lets you remove stale or unwanted participants from a group chat
- **Batch resume/abort:** New controls in the right panel for resuming or aborting batch operations
- **Default worktree directory:** Worktree configuration now defaults to the parent of the agent's working directory instead of blank
- **Drawfinity in Symphony:** Added Drawfinity to the Symphony project registry

## v0.12.x - Thinking, Spec-Kits, Context Management

**Latest: v0.12.3** | Released December 28, 2025

The big changes in the v0.12.x line are the following three:

## Show Thinking

🤔 There is now a toggle to show thinking for the agent, the default for new tabs is off, though this can be changed under Settings > General. The toggle shows next to History and Read-Only. Very similar pattern. This has been the #1 most requested feature, though personally, I don't think I'll use it as I prefer to not see the details of the work, but the results of the work. Just as we work with our colleagues.

## GitHub Spec-Kit Integration

🎯 Added [GitHub Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) commands into Maestro with a built-in updater to grab the latest prompts from the repository. We do override `/speckit-implement` (the final step) to create Auto Run docs and guide the user through their execution, which thanks to Wortrees from v0.11.x allows us to run in parallel!

## Context Management Tools

📖 Added context management options from tab right-click menu. You can now compress, merge, and transfer contexts between agents. You will received (configurable) warnings at 60% and 80% context consumption with a hint to compact.

## Changes Specific to v0.12.3:

- We now have hosted documentation through Mintlify 📚
- Export any tab conversation as self-contained themed HTML file 📄
- Publish files as private/public Gists 🌐
- Added tab hover overlay menu with close operations and export 📋
- Added social handles to achievement share images 🏆

### Previous Releases in this Series

- **v0.12.1** (December 27, 2025) - Thinking, Spec-Kits, Context Management
- **v0.12.0** (December 25, 2025) - Thinking, Spec-Kits, Context Management

## v0.11.x - Worktrees

**Latest: v0.11.0** | Released December 22, 2025

🌳 GitHub Worktree support was added. Any agent bound to a Git repository has the option to enable worktrees, each of which show up as a sub-agent with their own write-lock and Auto Run capability. Now you can truly develop in parallel on the same project and issue PRs when you're ready, all from within Maestro. Huge improvement, major thanks to @petersilberman.

### Other Changes

- @ file mentions now include documents from your Auto Run folder (which may not live in your agent working directory) 🗄️
- The wizard is now capable of detecting and continuing on past started projects 🧙
- Bug fixes 🐛🐜🐞
